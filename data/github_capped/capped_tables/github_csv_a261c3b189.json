      "2.1. Rats in 1 Week Experiment All experimental procedures were approved by Auburn University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol # 2016-2814, approval date 6 January 2016). Male Fisher 344 rats at 4 months of age (~360 g) were purchased (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and allowed to acclimate in the animal housing facility at Auburn University for 1 week prior to experimentation. During acclimation, rats were provided standard rodent chow (SC; 24% (% kcal) protein, 58% CHO (2.8% fiber w/w), 18% fat; Teklad Global #2018 Diet, Harlan Laboratories) and water ad libitum in a maintained ambient temperature and constant 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle. For a 1 week period following acclimation, rats were provided isocaloric-isonitrogenous-isofibrous amounts of one of three diets: (1) 10 rats (SC) were provided with 20 g/day of the aforementioned SC given during the acclimation phase.",

Casein protein (Optimum Nutrition Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA) and cellulose powder (Allergy Research Group, Alameda, CA, USA) were added to better compensate for between group differences in protein and fiber content (added protein and fiber were 23.5% of the modified diet). The diet specifications (following modifications) were as follows: 4.15 kcal/g, 23% protein, 10% carbohydrate (2.9% fiber w/w), and 67% fat. Medium chain triglycerides, flaxseed oil and canola oil were prominent fat sources in the parent KD.  (3) 10 rats (SC + KS) were provided with 20 g/day of the aforementioned SC, along with sodium bodies beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) salt (DL-3 sodium hydroxybutyric acid, 5.",

Rats in 8 Months Experiment As with the procedures outlined above, 8 months experimental procedures were approved by Auburn University\u2019s IACUC (protocol # 2016-2814, approval date 6 January 2016). Male Fisher 344 rats 4 months of age (~360 g) were purchased (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and allowed to acclimate in the animal housing facility for 1 week prior to experimentation in the same manner as described above.",

In the SC + KS group, KS were added to water bottles attempting to deliver ~2.2 g/day for the first week as a \u201cloading phase\u201d, then 0.3 g/day as a \u201cmaintenance phase\u201d for the remaining duration. This dosing schedule was designed with the intent of delivering a human-equivalent dose of 40 g/day dose during the loading phase and a 10 g/day dose during the maintenance phase per the body surface area rat-to-human conversions of Reagan-Shaw et al. described above. One SC + KS rat inexplicably lost >20% body mass during the first two months of treatment and, thus, was euthanized for humane reasons and not included in the analyses. One SC rat experienced rapid weight loss towards the end of the 8 months intervention.",

Notably, bodyweights were recorded weekly, food intakes were recorded daily, and water was measured daily in order to ascertain the amount of KS ingested by the SC + KS group.  2.3. Rotarod Performance in 8 Month-Fed Rats Rotarod performance is used in rodent studies to assess a combination of balance, grip strength, motor coordination and muscular endurance [23]. In 8 month-fed rats, rotarod performance was assessed at 2, 4, 6 and 8 months into the intervention using a single-lane device (Product#: ENV-571R; Med Associates Inc., Saint Albans City, VT, USA). Briefly, all assessments took place during the beginning of the rat light cycle (i.e., 0600\u20130800) whereby rats were placed on the device and the motorized rotor was initiated at a progressive speed from 4.0 to 40.0 r/min.",

Necropsies and Tissue Preparation in Rats from Both Feeding Experiments On the morning of necropsies (0500\u20130600), rats were food-deprived but provided water ad libitum. Rats were then transported from the campus vivarium to the School of Kinesiology and allowed to acclimate for 2\u20133 h. Thereafter, rats were euthanized under CO2 gas in a 2 L induction chamber (VetEquip, Pleasanton, CA, USA). Following euthanasia, a final body mass was recorded, and blood was collected from the heart using a 22 gauge syringe. Collected blood was placed in a 6 mL serum separator tube and allowed to clot, centrifuged at 3500 g for 10 min, and resultant serum was aliquoted into 2.7 mL microcentrifuge tubes for storage at \u221280 \u00b0C until analysis.
