They give these equations: \\begin{align}\\hat{r} &= \\cos(\\theta)\\hat{i} + \\sin(\\theta)\\hat{j}\\\\\n\\hat{\\theta} &= -\\sin(\\theta)\\hat{i} + \\cos(\\theta)\\hat{j}\\end{align} I'm just not getting it.

Can anyone see a straightforward way of doing this?",

      "I've never been that great at writing proofs, but I'm getting a bit better. I think I have the answer correct, but I don't know if I'm missing anything. My logic seems right but there may be some minute detail that I'm leaving out. Can anybody give any feedback on this? Thanks. $\\vec{0}$ being a nontrivial linear combination of $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$ implies that there exists a non-zero $a$ or $b$ such that $a\\vec{u}=-b\\vec{v}$. Without loss of generality, assume $a\\neq 0$. Then divide by $a$ and the equality holds: $\\vec{u}=-\\frac{b}{a}\\vec{v}$. And since $-\\frac{b}{a}\\vec{v}$ is a scalar multiple of $\\vec{u}$, it remains that $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}$ are parallel. More rigorous proof:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\vec{0}=a\\vec{u}+b\\vec{v}&\\Longrightarrow a\\neq 0\\vee b\\neq 0&&\\text{Given}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow a\\vec{u}=-b\\vec{v}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow \\vec{u}=-\\frac{b}{a}\\vec{v}&&\\text{WLOG assume $a\\neq 0$}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow \\vec{u}\\text{ and }\\vec{v}\\text{ are parallel.}\n\\end{align*}",

      "Transitivity of union of two transitive relations",
      "I have a question concerning proving properties of Relations. The question is this: How would I go about proving that, if R and S (R and S both being different Relations) are transitive, then R union S is transitive? The answer is actually FALSE, and then a counter example is given as a solution in the book. I understand how the counterexample works as explained in the book, but what I don't understand is, how exactly they arrive to the conclusion that the statement is actually false. Basically I can see myself giving a proof that if that for all values (x,y,z) in R and S, if (x,y) is in R and (y,z) is in R, (x, z) is in R since R is transitive. And if (x,y) is in S and (y,z) is in R, (x,z) is in S since S is transitive. Since (x,z) is in both R and S, the intersection is true. But why wouldn't the union of R and S be true as well? Is it because that the proof cannot be ended with \"since (x,z) is in both R and S, (x,z) can be in R or S\"? Basically, that a proof can't be ended with an OR statement at the end?

I'm studying Differential Geometry through Spivak's book \"A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry Vol. 1\" and I'm looking for video lectures on differential geometry at this level (introduction to the analysis on manifolds and so on). Until now I didn't find any video lectures. The only ones I've founded related to that are the one in the question I've mentioned, however that's too advanced for now. There are any good video lectures on this introductory (but yet rigorous) Differential Geometry? And I've pointed the rigorous part because I've found some videos on youtube, however the ones I've found simply ignore rigorous aspects of the subject and do things too loosely (even without defining manifolds properly).
