Three White Sturgeon were captured, tagged, and relocated to the SJR. Two sturgeon were captured on 22 June and one on 24 June 2021. After the relocation, CDFW monitored the same pool in the Tuolumne River throughout the summer by using an Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS, Explorer 1800) for the presence of any remaining sturgeon. The ARIS captured images of one sturgeon on 8 August 2021 and another image of two sturgeon three weeks later (Fig. 3). We did not attempt to capture either sturgeon due to increased handling stress related to summer air temperatures and shallow depths at the relocation site. CDFW continued to confirm the presence of these fish until September, when Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) covered the pool and prevented CDFW from monitoring with a boat and ARIS. CDFW was able to resume monitoring in December after precipitation increased flows, moving the large patch of vegetation downstream; however, no sturgeon were detected with the ARIS."
