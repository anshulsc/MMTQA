            "when that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate , our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate .",
            "the yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability .",
            "the term of our obligation , based on the expected retirement dates of our workforce , is approximately ten years .",
            "in developing our expected rate of return assumption , we have evaluated the actual historical performance and long-term return projections of the plan assets , which give consideration to the asset mix and the anticipated timing of the pension plan outflows .",
            "we employ a total return investment approach whereby a mix of equity and fixed income investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for what we consider a prudent level of risk .",
            "the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run .",
            "risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities , plan funded status and our financial condition .",
