            "there were no options granted in excess of market value in 2011 , 2010 or 2009 .",
            "shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 33775543 at december 31 , 2011 .",
            "total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 35304422 shares at december 31 , 2011 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans and the employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) as described below .",
            "during 2011 , we issued 731336 shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity .",
            "as with past exercise activity , we currently intend to utilize primarily treasury stock for any future stock option exercises .",
            "awards granted to non-employee directors in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 include 27090 , 29040 , and 39552 deferred stock units , respectively , awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan .",
            "a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment until such awards are paid to the participants as cash .",
            "as there are no vesting or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on awarded deferred stock units on the date of grant .",
            "incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant .",
            "the value of certain incentive/ performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period .",
            "the personnel and compensation committee of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards .",
            "restricted stock/unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months .",
            "beginning in 2011 , we incorporated two changes to certain awards under our existing long-term incentive compensation programs .",
            "first , for certain grants of incentive performance units , the future payout amount will be subject to a negative annual adjustment if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics .",
            "this adjustment is in addition to the existing financial performance metrics relative to our peers .",
            "these grants have a three-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash .",
            "second , performance-based restricted share units ( performance rsus ) were granted in 2011 to certain of our executives in lieu of stock options .",
            "these performance rsus ( which are payable solely in stock ) have a service condition , an internal risk-related performance condition , and an external market condition .",
            "satisfaction of the performance condition is based on four independent one-year performance periods .",
            "the weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $ 63.25 , $ 54.59 and $ 41.16 per share , respectively .",
            "we recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or performance periods for each type of program .",
