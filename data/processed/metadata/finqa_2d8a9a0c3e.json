            "at december 31 , 2018 , we had approximately $ 96 million of tax liabilities , net of $ 1 million of tax assets , related to uncertain tax positions , each of which are individually insignificant , and each of which are reasonably possible of being settled within the next twelve months .",

            "stock-based compensation cost was $ 121 million and $ 37 million in 2018 and 2017 , respectively .",
            "stock-based compensation cost is measured at the date of grant based on the calculated fair value of the award and is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the equity grant .",
            "the compensation cost is determined based on awards ultimately expected to vest ; therefore , we have reduced the cost for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates .",
