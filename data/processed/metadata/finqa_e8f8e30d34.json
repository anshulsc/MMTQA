            "inventories , net inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market , cost being determined using the last-in , first-out ( \"lifo\" ) method for approximately 93% ( 93 % ) of inventories at both december 30 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 .",
            "under the lifo method , the company 2019s cost of sales reflects the costs of the most currently purchased inventories while the inventory carrying balance represents the costs relating to prices paid in prior years .",
            "the company 2019s costs to acquire inventory have been generally decreasing in recent years as a result of its significant growth .",
            "accordingly , the cost to replace inventory is less than the lifo balances carried for similar product .",
            "as a result of the lifo method and the ability to obtain lower product costs , the company recorded a reduction to cost of sales of $ 9978 for fiscal year ended 2006 , an increase in cost of sales of $ 526 for fiscal year ended 2005 and a reduction to cost of sales of $ 11212 for fiscal year ended 2004 .",
            "the remaining inventories are comprised of product cores , which consist of the non-consumable portion of certain parts and batteries and are valued under the first-in , first-out ( \"fifo\" ) method .",
            "core values are included as part of our merchandise costs and are either passed on to the customer or returned to the vendor .",
            "additionally , these products are not subject to the frequent cost changes like our other merchandise inventory , thus , there is no material difference from applying either the lifo or fifo valuation methods .",
            "the company capitalizes certain purchasing and warehousing costs into inventory .",
            "purchasing and warehousing costs included in inventory , at fifo , at december 30 , 2006 and december 31 , 2005 , were $ 95576 and $ 92833 , respectively .",
