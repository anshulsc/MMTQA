            "off-balance-sheet arrangements we have a number of off-balance-sheet investments , including joint ven- tures and debt and preferred equity investments .",
            "these investments all have varying ownership structures .",
            "substantially all of our joint venture arrangements are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence , but not control over the operating and financial decisions of these joint venture arrange- ments .",
            "our off-balance-sheet arrangements are discussed in note a0 5 , 201cdebt and preferred equity investments 201d and note a0 6 , 201cinvestments in unconsolidated joint ventures 201d in the accompanying consolidated finan- cial statements .",
            "additional information about the debt of our unconsoli- dated joint ventures is included in 201ccontractual obligations 201d below .",
            "capital expenditures we estimate that , for the year ending december a031 , 2011 , we will incur approximately $ 120.5 a0 million of capital expenditures , which are net of loan reserves ( including tenant improvements and leasing commis- sions ) , on existing wholly-owned properties , and that our share of capital expenditures at our joint venture properties , net of loan reserves , will be approximately $ 23.4 a0million .",
            "we expect to fund these capital expen- ditures with operating cash flow , additional property level mortgage financings and cash on hand .",
            "future property acquisitions may require substantial capital investments for refurbishment and leasing costs .",
            "we expect that these financing requirements will be met in a similar fashion .",
            "we believe that we will have sufficient resources to satisfy our capital needs during the next 12-month period .",
            "thereafter , we expect our capital needs will be met through a combination of cash on hand , net cash provided by operations , borrowings , potential asset sales or addi- tional equity or debt issuances .",
            "above provides that , except to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes , we will not during any four consecu- tive fiscal quarters make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests in an aggregate amount in excess of 95% ( 95 % ) of funds from operations for such period , subject to certain other adjustments .",
            "as of december a0 31 , 2010 and 2009 , we were in compliance with all such covenants .",
            "market rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements .",
            "we use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes .",
            "a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2010 and 2009 , would increase our annual interest cost by approximately $ 11.0 a0mil- lion and $ 15.2 a0million and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by approximately $ 6.7 a0million and $ 6.4 a0million , respectively .",
            "we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value .",
            "derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income .",
            "if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earnings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings .",
            "the ineffective portion of a deriva- tive 2019s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings .",
            "approximately $ 4.1 a0billion of our long-term debt bore interest at fixed rates , and therefore the fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates .",
            "the interest rate on our variable rate debt and joint venture debt as of december a031 , 2010 ranged from libor plus 75 basis points to libor plus 400 basis points .",
            "contractual obligations combined aggregate principal maturities of mortgages and other loans payable , our 2007 unsecured revolving credit facility , senior unsecured notes ( net of discount ) , trust preferred securities , our share of joint venture debt , including as-of-right extension options , estimated interest expense ( based on weighted average interest rates for the quarter ) , and our obligations under our capital and ground leases , as of december a031 , 2010 , are as follows ( in thousands ) : ."
