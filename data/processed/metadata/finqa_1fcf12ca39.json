            "average securities purchased under resale agreements increased to $ 4.69 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 2.96 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2010 .",
            "average trading account assets increased to $ 2.01 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 376 million for 2010 .",
            "averages benefited largely from an increase in client demand associated with our trading activities .",
            "in connection with these activities , we traded in highly liquid fixed-income securities as principal with our custody clients and other third- parties that trade in these securities .",
            "our average investment securities portfolio increased to $ 103.08 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2011 from $ 96.12 billion for 2010 .",
            "the increase was generally the result of ongoing purchases of securities , partly offset by maturities and sales .",
            "in december 2010 , we repositioned our portfolio by selling approximately $ 11 billion of mortgage- and asset-backed securities and re-investing approximately $ 7 billion of the proceeds , primarily in agency mortgage-backed securities .",
            "the repositioning was undertaken to enhance our regulatory capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards , increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital , and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes .",
            "during 2011 , we purchased $ 54 billion of highly rated u.s .",
            "treasury securities , federal agency mortgage-backed securities and u.s .",

            "as of december 31 , 2011 , securities rated 201caaa 201d and 201caa 201d comprised approximately 89% ( 89 % ) of our portfolio , compared to 90% ( 90 % ) rated 201caaa 201d and 201caa 201d as of december 31 , 2010 .",
            "loans and leases averaged $ 12.18 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2011 , compared to $ 12.09 billion for 2010 .",
            "the increases primarily resulted from higher client demand for short-duration liquidity , offset in part by a decrease in leases and the purchased receivables added in connection with the conduit consolidation , mainly from maturities and pay-downs .",
            "for 2011 and 2010 , approximately 29% ( 29 % ) and 27% ( 27 % ) , respectively , of our average loan and lease portfolio was composed of short-duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their investment activities related to securities settlement .",
