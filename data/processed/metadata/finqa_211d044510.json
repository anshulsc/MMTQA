            "79 notes to the consolidated financial statements in 2012 , we determined the implied fair value of good- will for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 mil- lion and recognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model further discussed below .",
            "this impair- ment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impair- ment of pullmantur related assets within our consoli- dated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) .",
            "during the fourth quarter of 2014 , we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely- than-not that our royal caribbean international reporting unit 2019s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impair- ment test .",
            "the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions , limitations on accessing capital , changes in forecasted operating results , changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates .",
            "based on our qualitative assessment , we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus , we did not pro- ceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test .",
            "no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit 2019s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin , its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear suffi- cient to support its carrying value .",
            "we also performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmantur 2019s reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 .",
            "we did not perform a quali- tative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the two-step goodwill impairment test .",
            "we estimated the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model .",
            "the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results , weighted- average cost of capital , and terminal value .",
            "signifi- cantly impacting these assumptions are the transfer of vessels from our other cruise brands to pullmantur .",
            "the discounted cash flow model used our 2015 pro- jected operating results as a base .",
            "to that base , we added future years 2019 cash flows assuming multiple rev- enue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2015 on pullmantur 2019s reporting unit .",
            "we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario .",
            "we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to pullmantur 2019s reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital .",
            "based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows , we deter- mined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 52% ( 52 % ) resulting in no impairment to pullmantur 2019s goodwill .",
            "pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portuguese and latin american markets , with an increasing focus on latin america .",
            "the persistent economic instability in these markets has created sig- nificant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses .",
            "we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur 2019s business and valuation .",
            "further , the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues , operating costs , marketing , sell- ing and administrative expenses , interest rates , ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry 2019s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions , among other factors .",
            "if there are changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses , especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place , it is possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur 2019s reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required .",
            "of these factors , the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows .",
            "if the transfers do not occur , we will likely fail step one of the impairment test .",
