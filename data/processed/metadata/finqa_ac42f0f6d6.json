            "table of contents ( 2 ) includes capitalized lease obligations of $ 3.2 million and $ 0.1 million as of december 31 , 2015 and 2014 , respectively , which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet .",

            "adjusted ebitda , which is a measure defined in our credit agreements , means ebitda adjusted for certain items which are described in the table below .",
            "we have included a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda in the table below .",

            "non-gaap measures used by us may differ from similar measures used by other companies , even when similar terms are used to identify such measures .",
            "we believe that ebitda and adjusted ebitda provide helpful information with respect to our operating performance and cash flows including our ability to meet our future debt service , capital expenditures and working capital requirements .",
            "adjusted ebitda is also the primary measure used in certain key covenants and definitions contained in the credit agreement governing our senior secured term loan facility ( 201cterm loan 201d ) , including the excess cash flow payment provision , the restricted payment covenant and the net leverage ratio .",
            "these covenants and definitions are material components of the term loan as they are used in determining the interest rate applicable to the term loan , our ability to make certain investments , incur additional debt , and make restricted payments , such as dividends and share repurchases , as well as whether we are required to make additional principal prepayments on the term loan beyond the quarterly amortization payments .",
            "for further details regarding the term loan , see note 8 ( long-term debt ) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements .",
