            "at the acquisition date , cyvera 2019s ongoing research and development initiatives were primarily involved with the development of its veracode technology and the beadxpress reader .",
            "these two projects were approximately 50% ( 50 % ) and 25% ( 25 % ) complete at the date of acquisition , respectively .",
            "as of december 31 , 2006 , these two projects were approximately 90% ( 90 % ) and 80% ( 80 % ) complete , respectively .",
            "the value assigned to purchased ipr&d was determined by estimating the costs to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable products , estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects , and discounting the net cash flows to their present value .",
            "the revenue projections used to value the ipr&d were , in some cases , reduced based on the probability of developing a new technology , and considered the relevant market sizes and growth factors , expected trends in technology , and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by the company and its competitors .",
            "the resulting net cash flows from such projects are based on the company 2019s estimates of cost of sales , operating expenses , and income taxes from such projects .",
            "the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on estimated cost of capital calculations .",
            "due to the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the developmental projects , discount rates of 30% ( 30 % ) were considered appropriate for the ipr&d .",
            "the company believes that these discount rates were commensurate with the projects 2019stage of development and the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above .",
            "if these projects are not successfully developed , the sales and profitability of the combined company may be adversely affected in future periods .",
            "the company believes that the foregoing assumptions used in the ipr&d analysis were reasonable at the time of the acquisition .",
            "no assurance can be given , however , that the underlying assumptions used to estimate expected project sales , development costs or profitability , or the events associated with such projects , will transpire as estimated .",
            "at the date of acquisition , the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility , and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses .",
