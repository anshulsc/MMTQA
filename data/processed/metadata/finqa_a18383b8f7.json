            "during 2014 , $ 91 million of provision recapture was recorded for purchased impaired loans compared to $ 11 million of provision expense for 2013 .",

            "at december 31 , 2014 , the allowance for loan and lease losses was $ .9 billion on $ 4.4 billion of purchased impaired loans while the remaining $ .5 billion of purchased impaired loans required no allowance as the net present value of expected cash flows equaled or exceeded the recorded investment .",
            "as of december 31 , 2013 , the allowance for loan and lease losses related to purchased impaired loans was $ 1.0 billion .",
            "if any allowance for loan losses is recognized on a purchased impaired pool , which is accounted for as a single asset , the entire balance of that pool would be disclosed as requiring an allowance .",
            "subsequent increases in the net present value of cash flows will result in a provision recapture of any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses , to the extent applicable , and/or a reclassification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield , which will be recognized prospectively .",
            "individual loan transactions where final dispositions have occurred ( as noted above ) result in removal of the loans from their applicable pools for cash flow estimation purposes .",
            "the cash flow re-estimation process is completed quarterly to evaluate the appropriateness of the allowance associated with the purchased impaired loans .",
