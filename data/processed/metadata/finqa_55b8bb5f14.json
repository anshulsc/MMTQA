            "table of contents recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test prescribed by gaap .",
            "for those reporting units where it is required , the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value .",
            "if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount , goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary .",
            "to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , a second step is performed , wherein the reporting unit's carrying value of goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of goodwill .",
            "to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value , impairment exists and must be recognized .",
            "the calculation of estimated fair value is based on two valuation techniques , a discounted cash flow model ( income approach ) and a market adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues ( market approach ) , with each method being weighted in the calculation .",
            "the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination .",
            "the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit ( including any unrecognized intangible assets ) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit , as determined in the first step of the goodwill impairment test , was the price paid to acquire that reporting unit .",
            "recoverability of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives ( i.e .",
            "trademarks ) is determined on a relief from royalty methodology ( income approach ) , which is based on the implied royalty paid , at an appropriate discount rate , to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset .",
            "the present value of the after-tax cost savings ( i.e .",
            "royalty relief ) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset .",
            "any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess .",
            "intangible assets such as patents , customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives .",
