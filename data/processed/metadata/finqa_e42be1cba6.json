            "we use value-at-risk ( var ) as the primary means to measure and monitor market risk in customer-related trading activities .",
            "we calculate a diversified var at a 95% ( 95 % ) confidence interval .",
            "var is used to estimate the probability of portfolio losses based on the statistical analysis of historical market risk factors .",
            "a diversified var reflects empirical correlations across different asset classes .",

            "to help ensure the integrity of the models used to calculate var for each portfolio and enterprise-wide , we use a process known as backtesting .",
            "the backtesting process consists of comparing actual observations of gains or losses against the var levels that were calculated at the close of the prior day .",
            "this assumes that market exposures remain constant throughout the day and that recent historical market variability is a good predictor of future variability .",
            "our customer-related trading activity includes customer revenue and intraday hedging which helps to reduce losses , and may reduce the number of instances of actual losses exceeding the prior day var measure .",
            "there were two instances during 2014 under our diversified var measure where actual losses exceeded the prior day var measure .",
            "in comparison , there was one such instance during 2013 .",
