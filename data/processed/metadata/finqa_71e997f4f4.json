            "interest on each series is payable on may 30 and november 30 of each year until maturity .",
            "the estimated fair value of our senior notes as of december 31 , 2013 , based on quoted prices for the specific securities from transactions in over-the-counter markets ( level 2 ) , was $ 1649.5 million .",
            "we may redeem the senior notes at our election in whole or in part at any time prior to maturity at a redemption price equal to the greater of 1 ) 100 percent of the principal amount of the notes being redeemed ; or 2 ) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest ( not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the date of redemption ) , discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis at the treasury rate ( as defined in the debt agreement ) , plus 15 basis points in the case of the 2014 notes , 20 basis points in the case of the 2019 notes and 2021 notes , and 25 basis points in the case of the 2039 notes .",
            "we would also pay the accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes to the redemption date .",
            "we have entered into interest rate swap agreements which we designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed- rate obligations on our senior notes due 2019 and 2021 .",
            "see note 13 for additional information regarding the interest rate swap agreements .",
            "before our senior notes due november 30 , 2014 become payable , we intend to issue new senior notes in order to pay the $ 250 million owed .",
            "if we are not able to issue new senior notes , we intend to borrow against our senior credit facility to pay these notes .",
            "since we have the ability and intent to refinance these senior notes on a long-term basis with new notes or through our senior credit facility , we have classified these senior notes as long-term debt as of december 31 , 2013 .",

            "our oci is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments , unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges , unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities , and amortization of prior service costs and unrecognized gains and losses in actuarial assumptions on our defined benefit plans .",

            "unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reclassified to net earnings if we sell the security before maturity or if the unrealized loss is considered to be other-than-temporary .",
            "we typically hold our available-for-sale securities until maturity and are able to realize their amortized cost and therefore we do not have reclassification adjustments to net earnings on these securities .",
            "amounts related to defined benefit plans that are in oci are reclassified over the service periods of employees in the plan .",
            "the reclassification amounts are allocated to all employees in the plans and therefore the reclassified amounts may become part of inventory to the extent they are considered direct labor costs .",
