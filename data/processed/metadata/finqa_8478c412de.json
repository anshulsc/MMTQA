            "specifically , a loan that has a more severe delinquency history prior to modification will have a higher future default rate in the discounted cash flow analysis than a loan that was not as severely delinquent .",
            "for both of the one- to four-family and home equity loan portfolio segments , the pre- modification delinquency status , the borrower 2019s current credit score and other credit bureau attributes , in addition to each loan 2019s individual default experience and credit characteristics , are incorporated into the calculation of the specific allowance .",
            "a specific allowance is established to the extent that the recorded investment exceeds the discounted cash flows of a tdr with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses .",
            "the specific allowance for these individually impaired loans represents the forecasted losses over the estimated remaining life of the loan , including the economic concession to the borrower .",
            "effects if actual results differ historic volatility in the credit markets has substantially increased the complexity and uncertainty involved in estimating the losses inherent in the loan portfolio .",
            "in the current market it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in the quantitative and qualitative factors , including the impact of home equity lines of credit converting from interest only to amortizing loans or requiring borrowers to repay the loan in full at the end of the draw period , might impact the allowance for loan losses .",
            "if our underlying assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate , the allowance for loan losses could be insufficient to cover actual losses .",
            "we may be required under such circumstances to further increase the provision for loan losses , which could have an adverse effect on the regulatory capital position and results of operations in future periods .",
            "during the normal course of conducting examinations , our banking regulators , the occ and federal reserve , continue to review our business and practices .",
            "this process is dynamic and ongoing and we cannot be certain that additional changes or actions will not result from their continuing review .",

            "goodwill and other intangible assets net of amortization were $ 1.8 billion and $ 0.2 billion , respectively , at december 31 , 2013 .",
            "judgments goodwill is allocated to reporting units , which are components of the business that are one level below operating segments .",
            "reporting units are evaluated for impairment individually during the annual assessment .",
            "estimating the fair value of reporting units and the assets , liabilities and intangible assets of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments , particularly related to cash flows , the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium .",
            "management judgment is required to assess whether the carrying value of the reporting unit can be supported by the fair value of the individual reporting unit .",
            "there are various valuation methodologies , such as the market approach or discounted cash flow methods , that may be used to estimate the fair value of reporting units .",
            "in applying these methodologies , we utilize a number of factors , including actual operating results , future business plans , economic projections , and market data .",
