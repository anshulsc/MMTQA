            "during the 2015 annual review of goodwill , management proceeded directly to the two-step quantitative impairment test for two reporting units as follows : global rolled products segment and the soft alloys extrusion business in brazil ( hereafter 201csae 201d ) , which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment .",
            "the estimated fair value of the global rolled products segment was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value , resulting in no impairment .",
            "for sae , the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value .",
            "as a result , management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of the sae reporting unit 2019s goodwill .",
            "the results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of the goodwill was zero .",
            "therefore , in the fourth quarter of 2015 , alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 25 .",
            "the impairment of the sae goodwill resulted from headwinds from the recent downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies .",
            "as a result of the goodwill impairment , there is no goodwill remaining for the sae reporting unit .",
            "goodwill impairment tests in prior years indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company 2019s reporting units , except for the primary metals segment in 2013 ( see below ) , and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an impairment test .",
            "in 2013 , for primary metals , the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value .",
            "as a result , management performed the second step of the impairment analysis in order to determine the implied fair value of primary metals 2019 goodwill .",
            "the results of the second-step analysis showed that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero .",
            "therefore , in the fourth quarter of 2013 , alcoa recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 1731 ( $ 1719 after noncontrolling interest ) .",
            "as a result of the goodwill impairment , there is no goodwill remaining for the primary metals reporting unit .",
            "the impairment of primary metals 2019 goodwill resulted from several causes : the prolonged economic downturn ; a disconnect between industry fundamentals and pricing that has resulted in lower metal prices ; and the increased cost of alumina , a key raw material , resulting from expansion of the alumina price index throughout the industry .",
            "all of these factors , exacerbated by increases in discount rates , continue to place significant downward pressure on metal prices and operating margins , and the resulting estimated fair value , of the primary metals business .",
            "as a result , management decreased the near-term and long-term estimates of the operating results and cash flows utilized in assessing primary metals 2019 goodwill for impairment .",
            "the valuation of goodwill for the second step of the goodwill impairment analysis is considered a level 3 fair value measurement , which means that the valuation of the assets and liabilities reflect management 2019s own judgments regarding the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities .",
            "intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited .",
