            "2011 compared to 2010 mfc 2019s net sales for 2011 increased $ 533 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , compared to 2010 .",
            "the increase was attributable to higher volume of about $ 420 million on air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) ; and about $ 245 million from fire control systems programs primarily related to the sof clss program , which began late in the third quarter of 2010 .",
            "partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales due to decreased volume of approximately $ 75 million primarily from various services programs and approximately $ 20 million from tactical missile programs ( primarily mlrs and jassm ) .",
            "mfc 2019s operating profit for 2011 increased $ 96 million , or 10% ( 10 % ) , compared to 2010 .",
            "the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of about $ 60 million for air and missile defense programs ( primarily pac-3 and thaad ) as a result of increased volume and retirement of risks ; and approximately $ 25 million for various services programs .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 35 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 .",
            "backlog backlog increased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to increased orders and lower sales on fire control systems programs ( primarily lantirn ae and sniper ae ) and on various services programs , partially offset by lower orders and higher sales volume on tactical missiles programs .",
            "backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increased orders on air and missile defense programs ( primarily thaad ) .",
            "trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales for 2013 will be comparable with 2012 .",
            "we expect low double digit percentage growth in air and missile defense programs , offset by an expected decline in volume on logistics services programs .",
            "operating profit and margin are expected to be comparable with 2012 results .",
