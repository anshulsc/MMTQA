            "our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined , including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries , the costs of purchased products and manufacturing expenses , including depreciation .",
            "the crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil , commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin .",
            "crack spreads can fluctuate significantly , particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil .",

            "posted light louisiana sweet ( 201clls 201d ) prices and a 6-3-2-1 ratio of products ( 6 barrels of crude oil producing 3 barrels of gasoline , 2 barrels of distillate and 1 barrel of residual fuel ) are used for the crack spread calculation .",
            "our refineries can process significant amounts of sour crude oil which typically can be purchased at a discount to sweet crude oil .",
            "the amount of this discount , the sweet/sour differential , can vary significantly causing our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin to differ from the crack spreads which are based upon sweet crude .",
            "in general , a larger sweet/sour differential will enhance our refining and wholesale marketing gross margin .",
            "in 2009 , the sweet/sour differential narrowed , due to a variety of worldwide economic and petroleum industry related factors , primarily related to lower hydrocarbon demand .",
            "sour crude accounted for 50 percent , 52 percent and 54 percent of our crude oil processed in 2009 , 2008 and 2007 .",
