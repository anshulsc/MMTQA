            "the number of shares to be delivered will equal the cse award value divided by the then fair market value of the common stock .",
            "for cses awarded to certain employees whose compensation structure was approved by the special master , 50% ( 50 % ) of the shares to be delivered in april 2010 will be subject to restrictions on sale and transfer until january 20 , 2011 .",
            "in lieu of 2010 cap awards , certain retirement-eligible employees were instead awarded cses payable in april 2010 , but any shares that are to be delivered in april 2010 ( subject to stockholder approval ) will be subject to restrictions on sale or transfer that will lapse in four equal annual installments beginning january 20 , 2011 .",
            "cse awards have generally been accrued as compensation expenses in the year 2009 and will be recorded as a liability from the january 2010 grant date until the settlement date in april 2010 .",
            "if stockholders approve delivery of citigroup stock for the cse awards , cse awards will likely be paid as new issues of common stock as an exception to the company 2019s practice of delivering shares from treasury stock , and the recorded liability will be reclassified as equity at that time .",
            "in january 2009 , members of the management executive committee ( except the ceo and cfo ) received 30% ( 30 % ) of their incentive awards for 2008 as performance vesting-equity awards .",
            "these awards vest 50% ( 50 % ) if the price of citigroup common stock meets a price target of $ 10.61 , and 50% ( 50 % ) for a price target of $ 17.85 , in each case on or prior to january 14 , 2013 .",
            "the price target will be met only if the nyse closing price equals or exceeds the applicable price target for at least 20 nyse trading days within any period of 30 consecutive nyse trading days ending on or before january 14 , 2013 .",
            "any shares that have not vested by such date will vest according to a fraction , the numerator of which is the share price on the delivery date and the denominator of which is the price target of the unvested shares .",
            "no dividend equivalents are paid on unvested awards .",
            "fair value of the awards is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period .",
            "on july 17 , 2007 , the committee approved the management committee long-term incentive plan ( mc ltip ) ( pursuant to the terms of the shareholder-approved 1999 stock incentive plan ) under which participants received an equity award that could be earned based on citigroup 2019s performance against various metrics relative to peer companies and publicly- stated return on equity ( roe ) targets measured at the end of each calendar year beginning with 2007 .",
            "the final expense for each of the three consecutive calendar years was adjusted based on the results of the roe tests .",
            "no awards were earned for 2009 , 2008 or 2007 and no shares were issued because performance targets were not met .",
            "no new awards were made under the mc ltip since the initial award in july 2007 .",
            "cap participants in 2008 , 2007 , 2006 and 2005 , and fa cap participants in those years and in 2009 , could elect to receive all or part of their award in stock options .",
            "the figures presented in the stock option program tables ( see 201cstock option programs 201d below ) include options granted in lieu of cap and fa cap stock awards in those years .",
