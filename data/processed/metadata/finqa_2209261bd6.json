            "capital resources and liquidity capital resources overview capital has historically been generated by earnings from citi 2019s operating businesses .",
            "citi may also augment its capital through issuances of common stock , convertible preferred stock , preferred stock , equity issued through awards under employee benefit plans , and , in the case of regulatory capital , through the issuance of subordinated debt underlying trust preferred securities .",
            "in addition , the impact of future events on citi 2019s business results , such as corporate and asset dispositions , as well as changes in accounting standards , also affect citi 2019s capital levels .",
            "generally , capital is used primarily to support assets in citi 2019s businesses and to absorb market , credit , or operational losses .",
            "while capital may be used for other purposes , such as to pay dividends or repurchase common stock , citi 2019s ability to utilize its capital for these purposes is currently restricted due to its agreements with the u.s .",
            "government , generally for so long as the u.s .",
            "government continues to hold citi 2019s common stock or trust preferred securities .",
            "see also 201csupervision and regulation 201d below .",
            "citigroup 2019s capital management framework is designed to ensure that citigroup and its principal subsidiaries maintain sufficient capital consistent with citi 2019s risk profile and all applicable regulatory standards and guidelines , as well as external rating agency considerations .",
            "the capital management process is centrally overseen by senior management and is reviewed at the consolidated , legal entity , and country level .",
            "senior management is responsible for the capital management process mainly through citigroup 2019s finance and asset and liability committee ( finalco ) , with oversight from the risk management and finance committee of citigroup 2019s board of directors .",
            "the finalco is composed of the senior-most management of citigroup for the purpose of engaging management in decision-making and related discussions on capital and liquidity matters .",
            "among other things , finalco 2019s responsibilities include : determining the financial structure of citigroup and its principal subsidiaries ; ensuring that citigroup and its regulated entities are adequately capitalized in consultation with its regulators ; determining appropriate asset levels and return hurdles for citigroup and individual businesses ; reviewing the funding and capital markets plan for citigroup ; and monitoring interest rate risk , corporate and bank liquidity , and the impact of currency translation on non-u.s .",

            "capital ratios citigroup is subject to the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board .",
            "historically , capital adequacy has been measured , in part , based on two risk-based capital ratios , the tier 1 capital and total capital ( tier 1 capital + tier 2 capital ) ratios .",
            "tier 1 capital consists of the sum of 201ccore capital elements , 201d such as qualifying common stockholders 2019 equity , as adjusted , qualifying noncontrolling interests , and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts , principally reduced by goodwill , other disallowed intangible assets , and disallowed deferred tax assets .",
            "total capital also includes 201csupplementary 201d tier 2 capital elements , such as qualifying subordinated debt and a limited portion of the allowance for credit losses .",
            "both measures of capital adequacy are stated as a percentage of risk-weighted assets .",
            "further , in conjunction with the conduct of the 2009 supervisory capital assessment program ( scap ) , u.s .",
            "banking regulators developed a new measure of capital termed 201ctier 1 common , 201d which has been defined as tier 1 capital less non-common elements , including qualifying perpetual preferred stock , qualifying noncontrolling interests , and qualifying mandatorily redeemable securities of subsidiary trusts .",
            "citigroup 2019s risk-weighted assets are principally derived from application of the risk-based capital guidelines related to the measurement of credit risk .",
            "pursuant to these guidelines , on-balance-sheet assets and the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance-sheet exposures ( such as financial guarantees , unfunded lending commitments , letters of credit , and derivatives ) are assigned to one of several prescribed risk-weight categories based upon the perceived credit risk associated with the obligor , or if relevant , the guarantor , the nature of the collateral , or external credit ratings .",
            "risk-weighted assets also incorporate a measure for market risk on covered trading account positions and all foreign exchange and commodity positions whether or not carried in the trading account .",
            "excluded from risk-weighted assets are any assets , such as goodwill and deferred tax assets , to the extent required to be deducted from regulatory capital .",
            "see 201ccomponents of capital under regulatory guidelines 201d below .",
            "citigroup is also subject to a leverage ratio requirement , a non-risk-based measure of capital adequacy , which is defined as tier 1 capital as a percentage of quarterly adjusted average total assets .",
            "to be 201cwell capitalized 201d under federal bank regulatory agency definitions , a bank holding company must have a tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6% ( 6 % ) , a total capital ratio of at least 10% ( 10 % ) , and a leverage ratio of at least 3% ( 3 % ) , and not be subject to a federal reserve board directive to maintain higher capital levels .",
