            "while we believe that the amounts included in our consolidated financial statements reflect our best judgment , actual amounts could ultimately materi- ally differ from those currently presented .",
            "we believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are : 2022 unpaid loss and loss expense reserves , including long-tail asbestos and environmental ( a&e ) reserves ; 2022 future policy benefits reserves ; 2022 valuation of value of business acquired ( voba ) and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and voba ; 2022 the assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts ; 2022 reinsurance recoverable , including a provision for uncollectible reinsurance ; 2022 impairments to the carrying value of our investment portfolio ; 2022 the valuation of deferred tax assets ; 2022 the valuation of derivative instruments related to guaranteed minimum income benefits ( gmib ) ; and 2022 the valuation of goodwill .",

            "unpaid losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company , we are required , by applicable laws and regulations and gaap , to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers .",
            "the estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but unpaid at the balance sheet date ( case reserves ) and for future obligations from claims that have been incurred but not reported ( ibnr ) at the balance sheet date ( ibnr may also include a provision for additional devel- opment on reported claims in instances where the case reserve is viewed to be potentially insufficient ) .",
            "the reserves provide for liabilities that exist for the company as of the balance sheet date .",

            "at december 31 , 2008 , our gross unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $ 37.2 billion and our net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves were $ 24.2 billion .",
            "with the exception of certain structured settlements , for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determi- nable , our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money .",
