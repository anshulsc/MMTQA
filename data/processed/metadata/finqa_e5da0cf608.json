            "related expenses incurred by our logistics subsidiaries for external transportation and increased crew transportation and lodging due to volumes and a slower network .",
            "in addition , higher consulting fees and higher contract expenses ( including equipment maintenance ) increased costs compared to 2013 .",
            "locomotive and freight car material expenses increased in 2014 compared to 2013 due to additional volumes , including the impact of activating stored equipment to address operational issues caused by demand and a slower network .",
            "expenses for purchased services increased 10% ( 10 % ) in 2013 compared to 2012 due to logistics management fees , an increase in locomotive overhauls and repairs on jointly owned property .",
            "depreciation 2013 the majority of depreciation relates to road property , including rail , ties , ballast , and other track material .",
            "depreciation was up 7% ( 7 % ) compared to 2013 .",
            "a higher depreciable asset base , reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase .",
            "depreciation was up 1% ( 1 % ) in 2013 compared to 2012 .",
            "recent depreciation studies allowed us to use longer estimated service lives for certain equipment , which partially offset the impact of a higher depreciable asset base resulting from larger capital spending in recent years .",
            "equipment and other rents 2013 equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies ; freight car , intermodal , and locomotive leases ; and office and other rent expenses .",
            "higher intermodal volumes and longer cycle times increased short-term freight car rental expense in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "lower equipment leases essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense , as we exercised purchase options on some of our leased equipment .",
            "additional container costs resulting from the logistics management arrangement , and increased automotive shipments , partially offset by lower cycle times drove a $ 51 million increase in our short-term freight car rental expense in 2013 versus 2012 .",
            "conversely , lower locomotive and freight car lease expenses partially offset the higher freight car rental expense .",
            "other 2013 other expenses include state and local taxes , freight , equipment and property damage , utilities , insurance , personal injury , environmental , employee travel , telephone and cellular , computer software , bad debt , and other general expenses .",
            "higher property taxes , personal injury expense and utilities costs partially offset by lower environmental expense and costs associated with damaged freight drove the increase in other costs in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "higher property taxes and costs associated with damaged freight and property increased other costs in 2013 compared to 2012 .",
            "continued improvement in our safety performance and lower estimated liability for personal injury , which reduced our personal injury expense year-over-year , partially offset increases in other costs .",
