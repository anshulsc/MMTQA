            "the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $ 50 million due to the favorable impact of the odin contract completion in 2011 ; about $ 25 million due to an increase in reserves for performance issues related to an international airborne surveillance system in 2012 ; and approximately $ 20 million due to lower volume on certain programs ( primarily c2bmc and win-t ) .",
            "partially offsetting the decreases was an increase in operating profit due to higher risk retirements of approximately $ 15 million from the twic program ; and about $ 10 million due to increased activity on numerous other programs , primarily federal cyber security programs and ptds operational support .",
