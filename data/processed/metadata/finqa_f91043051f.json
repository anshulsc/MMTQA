            "we recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the specified vesting period .",
            "at december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , options for 10204000 and 12759000 shares of common stock were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 89.46 and $ 90.86 , respectively .",
            "the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was $ 90 million , $ 86 million and $ 37 million , respectively .",
            "cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was approximately $ 215 million , $ 208 million and $ 118 million , respectively .",
            "the tax benefit realized from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2014 , 2013 and 2012 was approximately $ 33 million , $ 31 million and $ 14 million , respectively .",

            "total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 19017057 shares at december 31 , 2014 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans and the employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) as described below .",
            "during 2014 , we issued approximately 2.4 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity .",

            "a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which is accounted for as a liability until such awards are paid to the participants in cash .",

            "incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/share unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/share unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock on the date of grant .",
            "the value of certain incentive/performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals .",
            "the personnel and compensation committee ( 201cp&cc 201d ) of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to certain incentive/performance unit share awards .",
            "these awards have either a three-year or a four-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash .",
            "restricted stock/share unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 3 years to 5 years .",
            "beginning in 2013 , we incorporated several enhanced risk- related performance changes to certain long-term incentive compensation programs .",
            "in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics on both an absolute basis and relative to our peers , final payout amounts will be subject to reduction if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreements .",
            "however , the p&cc has the discretion to waive any or all of this reduction under certain circumstances .",
