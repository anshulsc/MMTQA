            "restricted stock unit awards under the plan have historically been settled in shares , but under this award will be settled in cash and are thus referred to as 201crestricted units 201d .",
            "the economic value recipients will ultimately realize will be identical to the value that would have been realized if the awards had been settled in shares , i.e. , upon settlement , recipients will receive cash equal to the hartford 2019s share price multiplied by the number of restricted units awarded .",
            "because restricted units will be settled in cash , the awards are remeasured at the end of each reporting period until settlement .",
            "awards granted in 2009 vested after a three year period .",
            "awards granted in 2010 include both graded and cliff vesting restricted units which vest over a three year period .",
            "the graded vesting attribution method is used to recognize the expense of the award over the requisite service period .",
            "for example , the graded vesting attribution method views one three-year grant with annual graded vesting as three separate sub-grants , each representing one third of the total number of awards granted .",
            "the first sub-grant vests over one year , the second sub-grant vests over two years and the third sub-grant vests over three years .",
            "there were no restricted units awarded for 2013 or 2012 .",
            "as of december 31 , 2013 and 2012 , 27 thousand and 832 thousand restricted units were outstanding , respectively .",

            "the deferred stock unit plan provides for contractual rights to receive cash payments based on the value of a specified number of shares of stock .",
            "the deferred stock unit plan provides for two award types , deferred units and restricted units .",
            "deferred units are earned ratably over a year , based on the number of regular pay periods occurring during such year .",
            "deferred units are credited to the participant's account on a quarterly basis based on the market price of the company 2019s common stock on the date of grant and are fully vested at all times .",
            "deferred units credited to employees prior to january 1 , 2010 ( other than senior executive officers hired on or after october 1 , 2009 ) are not paid until after two years from their grant date .",
            "deferred units credited on or after january 1 , 2010 ( and any credited to senior executive officers hired on or after october 1 , 2009 ) are paid in three equal installments after the first , second and third anniversaries of their grant date .",
            "restricted units are intended to be incentive compensation and , unlike deferred units , vest over time , generally three years , and are subject to forfeiture .",
            "the deferred stock unit plan is structured consistent with the limitations and restrictions on employee compensation arrangements imposed by the emergency economic stabilization act of 2008 and the tarp standards for compensation and corporate governance interim final rule issued by the u.s .",
