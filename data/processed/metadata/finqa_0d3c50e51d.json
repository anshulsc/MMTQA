            "valuation of long-lived assets we estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets and make estimates concerning undiscounted cash flows to review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset ( or asset group ) may not be recoverable .",

            "we use inputs from our long-range planning process to determine growth rates for sales and profits .",
            "we also make estimates of discount rates , perpetuity growth assumptions , market comparables , and other factors .",
            "we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets , mainly brands , to determine if they are finite or indefinite-lived .",
            "reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence , demand , competition , other economic factors ( such as the stability of the industry , known technological advances , legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment , and expected changes in distribution channels ) , the level of required maintenance expenditures , and the expected lives of other related groups of assets .",
            "intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis , over their useful lives , generally ranging from 4 to 30 years .",
            "our estimate of the fair value of our brand assets is based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which include projected revenues from our long-range plan , assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands , and a discount rate .",
            "as of may 26 , 2019 , we had $ 20.6 billion of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets .",
            "while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows , materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses or a different weighted-average cost of capital could result in material impairment losses and amortization expense .",
