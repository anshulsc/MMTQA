            "operating profit for the segment increased 10% ( 10 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 .",
            "the growth in operating profit primarily was due to increases in air mobility and other aeronautics programs .",
            "the $ 70 million increase in air mobility 2019s operating profit primarily was due to the higher volume on c-130j deliveries and c-130 support programs .",
            "in other aeronautics programs , operating profit increased $ 120 million , which mainly was attributable to improved performance in sustainment activities and higher volume on p-3 programs .",
            "additionally , the increase in operating profit included the favorable restructuring of a p-3 modification contract in 2009 .",
            "combat aircraft 2019s operating profit decreased $ 22 million during the year primarily due to a reduction in the level of favorable performance adjustments on f-16 programs in 2009 compared to 2008 and lower volume on other combat aircraft programs .",
            "these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on the f-35 program and an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f-22 program in 2009 compared to 2008 .",
            "the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to a decrease in other income , net , between the comparable periods .",
            "backlog increased in 2010 compared to 2009 mainly due to orders exceeding sales on the c-130j , f-35 and c-5 programs , which partially were offset by higher sales volume compared to new orders on the f-22 program in 2010 .",
            "backlog decreased in 2009 compared to 2008 mainly due to sales exceeding orders on the f-22 and f-35 programs , which partially were offset by orders exceeding sales on the c-130j and c-5 programs .",
            "we expect aeronautics will have sales growth in the upper single digit percentage range for 2011 as compared to 2010 .",
            "this increase primarily is driven by growth on f-35 low rate initial production ( lrip ) contracts , c-130j and c-5 rerp programs that will more than offset a decline on the f-22 program .",
            "operating profit is projected to increase at a mid single digit percentage rate above 2010 levels , resulting in a decline in operating margins between the years .",
            "similar to the relationship of operating margins from 2009 to 2010 discussed above , the expected operating margin decrease from 2010 to 2011 reflects the trend of aeronautics performing more development and initial production work on the f-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f-22 and f-16 , even though sales are expected to increase in 2011 relative to 2010 .",
            "electronic systems our electronic systems business segment manages complex programs and designs , develops , produces , and integrates hardware and software solutions to ensure the mission readiness of armed forces and government agencies worldwide .",
            "the segment 2019s three lines of business are mission systems & sensors ( ms2 ) , missiles & fire control ( m&fc ) , and global training & logistics ( gt&l ) .",
            "with such a broad portfolio of programs to provide products and services , many of its activities involve a combination of both development and production contracts with varying delivery schedules .",
            "some of its more significant programs , including the thaad system , the aegis weapon system , and the littoral combat ship program , demonstrate the diverse products and services electronic systems provides .",
