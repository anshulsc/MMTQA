            "2022 asset utilization 2013 in response to economic conditions and lower revenue in 2009 , we implemented productivity initiatives to improve efficiency and reduce costs , in addition to adjusting our resources to reflect lower demand .",
            "although varying throughout the year , our resource reductions included removing from service approximately 26% ( 26 % ) of our road locomotives and 18% ( 18 % ) of our freight car inventory by year end .",
            "we also reduced shift levels at most rail facilities and closed or significantly reduced operations in 30 of our 114 principal rail yards .",
            "these demand-driven resource adjustments and our productivity initiatives combined to reduce our workforce by 10% ( 10 % ) .",
            "2022 fuel prices 2013 as the economy worsened during the third and fourth quarters of 2008 , fuel prices dropped dramatically , reaching $ 33.87 per barrel in december 2008 , a near five-year low .",
            "throughout 2009 , crude oil prices generally increased , ending the year around $ 80 per barrel .",
            "overall , our average fuel price decreased by 44% ( 44 % ) in 2009 , reducing operating expenses by $ 1.3 billion compared to 2008 .",
            "we also reduced our consumption rate by 4% ( 4 % ) during the year , saving approximately 40 million gallons of fuel .",
            "the use of newer , more fuel efficient locomotives ; increased use of distributed locomotive power ; fuel conservation programs ; and improved network operations and asset utilization all contributed to this improvement .",
            "2022 free cash flow 2013 cash generated by operating activities totaled $ 3.2 billion , yielding free cash flow of $ 515 million in 2009 .",
            "free cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities , less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid .",
            "free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ( gaap ) by sec regulation g and item 10 of sec regulation s-k .",
            "we believe free cash flow is important in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financings .",
            "free cash flow should be considered in addition to , rather than as a substitute for , cash provided by operating activities .",
