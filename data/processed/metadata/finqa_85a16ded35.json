            "consumer lending asset classes home equity and residential real estate loan classes we use several credit quality indicators , including delinquency information , nonperforming loan information , updated credit scores , originated and updated ltv ratios , and geography , to monitor and manage credit risk within the home equity and residential real estate loan classes .",
            "we evaluate mortgage loan performance by source originators and loan servicers .",
            "a summary of asset quality indicators follows : delinquency/delinquency rates : we monitor trending of delinquency/delinquency rates for home equity and residential real estate loans .",
            "see the asset quality section of this note 3 for additional information .",
            "nonperforming loans : we monitor trending of nonperforming loans for home equity and residential real estate loans .",
            "see the asset quality section of this note 3 for additional information .",
            "credit scores : we use a national third-party provider to update fico credit scores for home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans at least quarterly .",
            "the updated scores are incorporated into a series of credit management reports , which are utilized to monitor the risk in the loan classes .",
            "ltv ( inclusive of combined loan-to-value ( cltv ) for first and subordinate lien positions ) : at least annually , we update the property values of real estate collateral and calculate an updated ltv ratio .",
            "for open-end credit lines secured by real estate in regions experiencing significant declines in property values , more frequent valuations may occur .",
            "we examine ltv migration and stratify ltv into categories to monitor the risk in the loan classes .",
            "historically , we used , and we continue to use , a combination of original ltv and updated ltv for internal risk management and reporting purposes ( e.g. , line management , loss mitigation strategies ) .",
            "in addition to the fact that estimated property values by their nature are estimates , given certain data limitations it is important to note that updated ltvs may be based upon management 2019s assumptions ( e.g. , if an updated ltv is not provided by the third-party service provider , home price index ( hpi ) changes will be incorporated in arriving at management 2019s estimate of updated ltv ) .",
            "geography : geographic concentrations are monitored to evaluate and manage exposures .",
            "loan purchase programs are sensitive to , and focused within , certain regions to manage geographic exposures and associated risks .",
            "a combination of updated fico scores , originated and updated ltv ratios and geographic location assigned to home equity loans and lines of credit and residential real estate loans is used to monitor the risk in the loan classes .",
            "loans with higher fico scores and lower ltvs tend to have a lower level of risk .",
            "conversely , loans with lower fico scores , higher ltvs , and in certain geographic locations tend to have a higher level of risk .",
            "consumer purchased impaired loan class estimates of the expected cash flows primarily determine the valuation of consumer purchased impaired loans .",
            "consumer cash flow estimates are influenced by a number of credit related items , which include , but are not limited to : estimated real estate values , payment patterns , updated fico scores , the current economic environment , updated ltv ratios and the date of origination .",
            "these key factors are monitored to help ensure that concentrations of risk are managed and cash flows are maximized .",
