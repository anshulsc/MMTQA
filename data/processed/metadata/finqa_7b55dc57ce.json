            "management 2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2006 bene- fited from strong gains in pricing and sales volumes and lower operating costs .",
            "our average paper and packaging prices in 2006 increased faster than our costs for the first time in four years .",
            "the improve- ment in sales volumes reflects increased uncoated papers , corrugated box , coated paperboard and european papers shipments , as well as improved revenues from our xpedx distribution business .",
            "our manufacturing operations also made solid cost reduction improvements .",
            "lower interest expense , reflecting debt repayments in 2005 and 2006 , was also a positive factor .",
            "together , these improvements more than offset the effects of continued high raw material and distribution costs , lower real estate sales , higher net corporate expenses and lower con- tributions from businesses and forestlands divested during 2006 .",
            "looking forward to 2007 , we expect seasonally higher sales volumes in the first quarter .",
            "average paper price realizations should continue to improve as we implement previously announced price increases in europe and brazil .",

            "operating results will benefit from the recently completed international paper/sun paperboard joint ventures in china and the addition of the luiz anto- nio paper mill to our operations in brazil .",
            "however , primarily as a result of lower real estate sales in the first quarter , we anticipate earnings from continuing operations will be somewhat lower than in the 2006 fourth quarter .",
            "significant steps were also taken in 2006 in the execution of the company 2019s transformation plan .",
            "we completed the sales of our u.s .",

            "through december 31 , 2006 , we have received approximately $ 9.7 billion of the estimated proceeds from divest- itures announced under this plan of approximately $ 11.3 billion , with the balance to be received as the remaining divestitures are completed in the first half of 2007 .",
            "we have strengthened our balance sheet by reducing debt by $ 6.2 billion , and returned value to our shareholders by repurchasing 39.7 million shares of our common stock for approximately $ 1.4 billion .",
            "we made a $ 1.0 billion voluntary contribution to our u.s .",

            "we have identified selective reinvestment opportunities totaling approx- imately $ 2.0 billion , including opportunities in china , brazil and russia .",
            "finally , we remain focused on our three-year $ 1.2 billion target for non-price profit- ability improvements , with $ 330 million realized during 2006 .",
            "while more remains to be done in 2007 , we have made substantial progress toward achiev- ing the objectives announced at the outset of the plan in july 2005 .",

            "industry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items .",
