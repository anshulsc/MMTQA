            "as such , in the fourth quarter of 2017 , arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of $ 719 .",
            "the decrease in the afe fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that is impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return , while the carrying value increased compared to prior year .",
            "goodwill impairment tests in 2016 and 2015 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company 2019s reporting units , except for the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil which is included in the transportation and construction solutions segment .",
            "in the fourth quarter of 2015 , for the soft alloy extrusion business in brazil , the estimated fair value as determined by the dcf model was lower than the associated carrying value of its reporting unit 2019s goodwill .",
            "as a result , management determined that the implied fair value of the reporting unit 2019s goodwill was zero .",
            "arconic recorded a goodwill impairment of $ 25 in 2015 .",
            "the impairment of goodwill resulted from headwinds from the downturn in the brazilian economy and the continued erosion of gross margin despite the execution of cost reduction strategies .",
