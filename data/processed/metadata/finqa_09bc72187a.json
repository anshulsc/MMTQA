            "revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties .",
            "management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services , which due to the terms of the contracts , are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory , administration fees and securities lending revenue .",
