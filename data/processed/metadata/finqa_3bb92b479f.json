            "also during 2006 , the entities acquired approximately $ 4.8 billion of international paper debt obligations for cash , resulting in a total of approximately $ 5.2 billion of international paper debt obligations held by the entities at december 31 , 2006 .",
            "the various agreements entered into in connection with these transactions provide that international paper has , and intends to effect , a legal right to offset its obligation under these debt instruments with its investments in the entities .",
            "accordingly , for financial reporting purposes , international paper has offset approximately $ 5.2 billion of class b interests in the entities against $ 5.3 billion of international paper debt obligations held by these entities at december 31 , 2014 and 2013 .",

            "the company recognized a $ 1.4 billion deferred tax liability in connection with the 2006 forestlands sale , which will be settled with the maturity of the timber notes in the third quarter of 2016 ( unless extended ) .",
            "during 2011 and 2012 , the credit ratings for two letter of credit banks that support $ 1.5 billion of timber notes were downgraded below the specified threshold .",
