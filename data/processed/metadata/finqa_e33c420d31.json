            "for example , our senior secured credit facility and outstanding debt securities at the parent company include events of default for certain bankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries .",
            "in addition , our revolving credit agreement at the parent company includes events of default related to payment defaults and accelerations of outstanding debt of material subsidiaries .",

            "the total non-recourse debt classified as current in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets amounts to $ 2.2 billion .",
            "the portion of current debt related to such defaults was $ 1 billion at december 31 , 2017 , all of which was non-recourse debt related to three subsidiaries 2014 alto maipo , aes puerto rico , and aes ilumina .",

            "however , as a result of additional dispositions of assets , other significant reductions in asset carrying values or other matters in the future that may impact our financial position and results of operations or the financial position of the individual subsidiary , it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries could fall within the definition of a \"material subsidiary\" and thereby upon an acceleration trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under the parent company's outstanding debt securities .",
            "a material subsidiary is defined in the company's senior secured revolving credit facility as any business that contributed 20% ( 20 % ) or more of the parent company's total cash distributions from businesses for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters .",
