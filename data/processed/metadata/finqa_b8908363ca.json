            "3m 2019s strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward .",
            "the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth , including continual review of acquisition opportunities .",

            "3m paid dividends of $ 1.380 billion in 2007 , and has a long history of dividend increases .",
            "in february 2008 , the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 4.2% ( 4.2 % ) to 50 cents per share , equivalent to an annual dividend of $ 2.00 per share .",

            "plans in 2008 .",
            "therefore , the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the u.s.-plans funding status as of the 2008 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution .",
            "future contributions will also depend on market conditions , interest rates and other factors .",

            "one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index , which includes accounts receivable , inventory and accounts payable .",
            "this combined index ( defined as quarterly net sales 2013 fourth quarter at year-end 2013 multiplied by four , divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable ) was 5.3 at december 31 , 2007 , down from 5.4 at december 31 , 2006 .",
