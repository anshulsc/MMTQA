            "kimco realty corporation and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements , continued the company 2019s investments in latin america are made through individual entities which are subject to local taxes .",
            "the company assesses each entity to determine if deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable .",
            "this assessment primarily includes an analysis of cumulative earnings and the determination of future earnings to the extent necessary to fully realize the individual deferred tax asset .",
            "based on this analysis the company has determined that a full valuation allowance is required for entities which have a three-year cumulative book loss and for which future earnings are not readily determinable .",
            "in addition , the company has determined that no valuation allowance is needed for entities that have three-years of cumulative book income and future earnings are anticipated to be sufficient to more likely than not realize their deferred tax assets .",
            "at december 31 , 2014 , the company had total deferred tax assets of $ 9.5 million relating to its latin american investments with an aggregate valuation allowance of $ 9.3 million .",
            "the company 2019s deferred tax assets in canada result principally from depreciation deducted under gaap that exceed capital cost allowances claimed under canadian tax rules .",
            "the deferred tax asset will naturally reverse upon disposition as tax basis will be greater than the basis of the assets under generally accepted accounting principles .",
            "as of december 31 , 2014 , the company determined that no valuation allowance was needed against a $ 65.5 million net deferred tax asset within krs .",
            "the company based its determination on an analysis of both positive evidence and negative evidence using its judgment as to the relative weight of each .",
            "the company believes , when evaluating krs 2019s deferred tax assets , special consideration should be given to the unique relationship between the company as a reit and krs as a taxable reit subsidiary .",
            "this relationship exists primarily to protect the reit 2019s qualification under the code by permitting , within certain limits , the reit to engage in certain business activities in which the reit cannot directly participate .",
            "as such , the reit controls which and when investments are held in , or distributed or sold from , krs .",
            "this relationship distinguishes a reit and taxable reit subsidiary from an enterprise that operates as a single , consolidated corporate taxpayer .",
            "the company will continue through this structure to operate certain business activities in krs .",
            "the company 2019s analysis of krs 2019s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets includes an estimate of future projected income .",
            "to determine future projected income , the company scheduled krs 2019s pre-tax book income and taxable income over a twenty year period taking into account its continuing operations ( 201ccore earnings 201d ) .",
            "core earnings consist of estimated net operating income for properties currently in service and generating rental income .",
            "major lease turnover is not expected in these properties as these properties were generally constructed and leased within the past seven years .",
            "the company can employ strategies to realize krs 2019s deferred tax assets including transferring its property management business or selling certain built-in gain assets .",
            "the company 2019s projection of krs 2019s future taxable income over twenty years , utilizing the assumptions above with respect to core earnings , net of related expenses , generates sufficient taxable income to absorb a reversal of the company 2019s deductible temporary differences , including net operating loss carryovers .",
            "based on this analysis , the company concluded it is more likely than not that krs 2019s net deferred tax asset of $ 65.5 million ( excluding net deferred tax assets of fnc discussed above ) will be realized and therefore , no valuation allowance is needed at december 31 , 2014 .",
            "if future income projections do not occur as forecasted or the company incurs additional impairment losses in excess of the amount core earnings can absorb , the company will reconsider the need for a valuation allowance .",
