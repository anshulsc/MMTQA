            "page 20 of 100 segment sales were $ 100.7 million lower in 2009 than in 2008 , primarily as a result of the impact of lower aluminum prices partially offset by an increase in sales volumes .",
            "the higher sales volumes in 2009 were the result of incremental volumes from the four plants purchased from ab inbev , partially offset by certain plant closures and lower sales volumes in the existing business .",
            "segment earnings in 2010 were $ 122.3 million higher than in 2009 primarily due to a net $ 85 million impact related to the higher sales volumes and $ 45 million of product mix and improved manufacturing performance associated with higher production .",
            "also adding to the 2010 improvement was the effect of a $ 7 million out-of-period inventory charge in 2009 .",
            "the details of the out-of-period adjustment are included in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included within item 8 of this report .",
            "segment earnings in 2009 were higher than in 2008 due to $ 12 million of earnings contribution from the four acquired plants and approximately $ 21 million of savings associated with plant closures .",
            "partially offsetting these favorable impacts were lower carbonated soft drink and beer can sales volumes ( excluding the newly acquired plants ) and approximately $ 25 million related to higher cost inventories in the first half of 2009 .",
