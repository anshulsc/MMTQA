            "prove 1 and prove 2 we expect that together , the prove 1 and prove 2 clinical trials will evaluate rates of sustained viral response , or svr , in approximately 580 treatment-na efve patients infected with genotype 1 hcv , including patients who will receive telaprevir and patients in the control arms .",

            "in the data reported , the patients in all three telaprevir-containing arms ( approximately 175 patients ) were pooled together and the results were compared to the results in the control arm of peg-ifn and rbv and placebo ( approximately 75 patients ) .",
