            "at december 31 , 2000 , the company had a total economic interest of 49.6% ( 49.6 % ) in eletropaulo .",
            "the company accounts for this investment using the equity method based on the related consortium agreement that allows the exercise of significant influence .",
            "in august 2000 , a subsidiary of the company acquired a 49% ( 49 % ) interest in songas limited for approxi- mately $ 40 million .",

            "pursuant to the acquisition , the company acquired 30% ( 30 % ) of the shares while edf acquired the remainder .",
            "with the completion of this transaction , the company owns approximately 21.14% ( 21.14 % ) of light .",
            "in december 2000 , a subsidiary of the company entered into an agreement with edf to jointly acquire an additional 9.2% ( 9.2 % ) interest in light , which is held by a sub- sidiary of companhia siderurgica nacional ( 201ccsn 201d ) .",

            "aes and edf intend to continue to pursue a fur- ther rationalization of their ownership stakes in light and eletropaulo , the result of which aes would become the sole controlling shareholder of eletropaulo and edf would become the sole controlling shareholder of light .",
            "upon consummation of the transaction , aes will begin consolidating eletropaulo 2019s operating results .",
            "the struc- ture and process by which this rationalization may be effected , and the resulting timing , have yet to be deter- mined and will likely be subject to approval by various brazilian regulatory authorities and other third parties .",
