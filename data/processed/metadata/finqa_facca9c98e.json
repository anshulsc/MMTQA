            "the number of performance-based rsus that ultimately vest is dependent on one or both of the following as per the terms of the specific award agreement : the achievement of 1 ) internal profitability targets ( performance condition ) and 2 ) market performance targets measured by the comparison of the company 2019s stock performance versus a defined peer group ( market condition ) .",

            "the ultimate number of shares of the company 2019s series a common stock issued will range from zero to stretch , with stretch defined individually under each award , net of personal income taxes withheld .",
            "the market condition is factored into the estimated fair value per unit and compensation expense for each award will be based on the probability of achieving internal profitability targets , as applicable , and recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective grant , less estimated forfeitures .",
            "for performance-based rsus granted without a performance condition , compensation expense is based on the fair value per unit recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the grant , less estimated forfeitures .",
            "in april 2007 , the company granted performance-based rsus to certain employees that vest annually in equal tranches beginning october 1 , 2008 through october 1 , 2011 and include a market condition .",
            "the performance- based rsus awarded include a catch-up provision that provides for an additional year of vesting of previously unvested amounts , subject to certain maximums .",
            "compensation expense is based on the fair value per unit recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the grant , less estimated forfeitures .",
