            "we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds , letters of credit , or insurance policies ( the financial assurance instruments ) , or trust deposits , which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets .",

            "because we currently have no liability for the financial assurance instruments , they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets ; however , we record capping , closure and post-closure liabilities and self-insurance liabilities as they are incurred .",
