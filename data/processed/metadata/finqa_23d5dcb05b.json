            "citigroup 2019s repurchases are primarily from government sponsored entities .",
            "the specific representations and warranties made by the company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer .",
            "market conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the company may agree to in loan sales .",
            "in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties , the company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans ( generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest ) with the identified defects or indemnify ( 201cmake-whole 201d ) the investor or insurer .",
            "the company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet .",
            "in the case of a repurchase , the company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans .",
            "the company 2019s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage .",
            "however , contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach .",
            "in the case of a repurchase , the loan is typically considered a credit- impaired loan and accounted for under sop 03-3 , 201caccounting for certain loans and debt securities , acquired in a transfer 201d ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 , receivables 2014loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ) .",
            "these repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics , because credit-impaired purchased sop 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans .",
            "the company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole .",
            "this estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage ( i.e. , the year the loans were sold ) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the : ( 1 ) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed ; ( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs .",
            "the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve .",
            "the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim .",
            "during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased .",
            "in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience .",
            "these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 .",
            "as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage .",
            "the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase .",
            "an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle .",
            "although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages .",
            "in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve .",
            "payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve .",
            "the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income .",
            "a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly .",
            "any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income .",
