            "as explained below , pursuant to sfas 123 ( r ) , the charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met .",
            "cap and certain other awards provide that participants who meet certain age and years of service conditions may continue to vest in all or a portion of the award without remaining employed by the company during the entire vesting period , so long as they do not compete with citigroup during that time .",
            "beginning in 2006 , awards to these retirement-eligible employees are recognized in the year prior to the grant in the same manner as cash incentive compensation is accrued .",
            "however , awards granted in january 2006 were required to be expensed in their entirety at the date of grant .",
            "prior to 2006 , all awards were recognized ratably over the stated vesting period .",
            "see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on page 122 for the impact of adopting sfas 123 ( r ) .",
            "from 2003 to 2007 , citigroup granted restricted or deferred shares annually under the citigroup ownership program ( cop ) to eligible employees .",
            "this program replaced the wealthbuilder , citibuilder and citigroup ownership stock option programs .",
            "under cop , eligible employees received either restricted or deferred shares of citigroup common stock that vest after three years .",
            "the last award under this program was in 2007 .",
            "unearned compensation expense associated with the stock grants represents the market value of citigroup common stock at the date of grant and is recognized as a charge to income ratably over the vesting period , except for those awards granted to retirement-eligible employees .",
            "the charge to income for awards made to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated based on the dates the retirement rules are met .",
            "on july 17 , 2007 , the personnel and compensation committee of citigroup 2019s board of directors approved the management committee long- term incentive plan ( mc ltip ) , under the terms of the shareholder- approved 1999 stock incentive plan .",
            "the mc ltip provides members of the citigroup management committee , including the ceo , cfo and the named executive officers in the citigroup proxy statement , an opportunity to earn stock awards based on citigroup 2019s performance .",
            "each participant received an equity award that will be earned based on citigroup 2019s performance for the period from july 1 , 2007 to december 31 , 2009 .",
            "three periods will be measured for performance ( july 1 , 2007 to december 31 , 2007 , full year 2008 and full year 2009 ) .",
            "the ultimate value of the award will be based on citigroup 2019s performance in each of these periods with respect to ( 1 ) total shareholder return versus citigroup 2019s current key competitors and ( 2 ) publicly stated return on equity ( roe ) targets measured at the end of each calendar year .",
            "if , in any of the three performance periods , citigroup 2019s total shareholder return does not exceed the median performance of the peer group , the participants will not receive award shares for that period .",
            "the awards will generally vest after 30 months .",
            "in order to receive the shares , a participant generally must be a citigroup employee on january 5 , 2010 .",
            "the final expense for each of the three calendar years will be adjusted based on the results of the roe tests .",
            "no awards were earned for 2008 or 2007 because performance targets were not met .",
            "no new awards were made under the mc ltip since the initial award in july 2007 .",
            "on january 22 , 2008 , special retention stock awards were made to key senior executive officers and certain other members of senior management .",
            "the awards vest ratably over two- or four-year periods .",
            "executives must remain employed through the vesting dates to receive the shares awarded , except in cases of death , disability , or involuntary termination other than for gross misconduct .",
            "unlike cap , post-employment vesting is not provided for participants who meet specified age and years of service conditions .",
            "shares subject to some of the awards are exempted from the stock ownership commitment .",
            "a summary of the status of citigroup 2019s unvested stock awards as of december 31 , 2008 , and changes during the 12 months ended december 31 , 2008 , is presented below : unvested stock awards shares weighted average grant date fair value ."
