            "32 | bhge 2018 form 10-k baker hughes rig count the baker hughes rig counts are an important business barometer for the drilling industry and its suppliers .",
            "when drilling rigs are active they consume products and services produced by the oil service industry .",
            "rig count trends are driven by the exploration and development spending by oil and natural gas companies , which in turn is influenced by current and future price expectations for oil and natural gas .",
            "the counts may reflect the relative strength and stability of energy prices and overall market activity , however , these counts should not be solely relied on as other specific and pervasive conditions may exist that affect overall energy prices and market activity .",
            "we have been providing rig counts to the public since 1944 .",
            "we gather all relevant data through our field service personnel , who obtain the necessary data from routine visits to the various rigs , customers , contractors and other outside sources as necessary .",
            "we base the classification of a well as either oil or natural gas primarily upon filings made by operators in the relevant jurisdiction .",
            "this data is then compiled and distributed to various wire services and trade associations and is published on our website .",
            "we believe the counting process and resulting data is reliable , however , it is subject to our ability to obtain accurate and timely information .",
            "rig counts are compiled weekly for the u.s .",
            "and canada and monthly for all international rigs .",
            "published international rig counts do not include rigs drilling in certain locations , such as russia , the caspian region and onshore china because this information is not readily available .",
            "rigs in the u.s .",
            "and canada are counted as active if , on the day the count is taken , the well being drilled has been started but drilling has not been completed and the well is anticipated to be of sufficient depth to be a potential consumer of our drill bits .",
            "in international areas , rigs are counted on a weekly basis and deemed active if drilling activities occurred during the majority of the week .",
            "the weekly results are then averaged for the month and published accordingly .",
            "the rig count does not include rigs that are in transit from one location to another , rigging up , being used in non-drilling activities including production testing , completion and workover , and are not expected to be significant consumers of drill bits .",
            "the rig counts are summarized in the table below as averages for each of the periods indicated. ."
