            "in addition , market risk management ( through delegated authority from the risk governance committee ) sets market risk limits and sub-limits at certain product and desk levels .",
            "the purpose of the firmwide limits is to assist senior management in controlling our overall risk profile .",

            "sub-limits set the desired maximum amount of exposure that may be managed by any particular business on a day-to-day basis without additional levels of senior management approval , effectively leaving day-to-day decisions to individual desk managers and traders .",
            "accordingly , sub-limits are a management tool designed to ensure appropriate escalation rather than to establish maximum risk tolerance .",
            "sub-limits also distribute risk among various businesses in a manner that is consistent with their level of activity and client demand , taking into account the relative performance of each area .",

            "when a risk limit has been exceeded ( e.g. , due to positional changes or changes in market conditions , such as increased volatilities or changes in correlations ) , it is escalated to senior managers in market risk management and/or the appropriate risk committee .",
            "such instances are remediated by an inventory reduction and/or a temporary or permanent increase to the risk limit .",
