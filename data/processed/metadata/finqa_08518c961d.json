            "discount rate 2014the assumed discount rate is used to determine the current retirement related benefit plan expense and obligations , and represents the interest rate that is used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to effectively settle a plan 2019s benefit obligations .",
            "the discount rate assumption is determined for each plan by constructing a portfolio of high quality bonds with cash flows that match the estimated outflows for future benefit payments to determine a single equivalent discount rate .",
            "benefit payments are not only contingent on the terms of a plan , but also on the underlying participant demographics , including current age , and assumed mortality .",
            "we use only bonds that are denominated in u.s .",
            "dollars , rated aa or better by two of three nationally recognized statistical rating agencies , have a minimum outstanding issue of $ 50 million as of the measurement date , and are not callable , convertible , or index linked .",
            "since bond yields are generally unavailable beyond 30 years , we assume those rates will remain constant beyond that point .",
            "taking into consideration the factors noted above , our weighted average discount rate for pensions was 5.23% ( 5.23 % ) and 5.84% ( 5.84 % ) , as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively .",
            "our weighted average discount rate for other postretirement benefits was 4.94% ( 4.94 % ) and 5.58% ( 5.58 % ) as of december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , respectively .",
            "expected long-term rate of return 2014the expected long-term rate of return on assets is used to calculate net periodic expense , and is based on such factors as historical returns , targeted asset allocations , investment policy , duration , expected future long-term performance of individual asset classes , inflation trends , portfolio volatility , and risk management strategies .",
            "while studies are helpful in understanding current trends and performance , the assumption is based more on longer term and prospective views .",
            "in order to reflect expected lower future market returns , we have reduced the expected long-term rate of return assumption from 8.50% ( 8.50 % ) , used to record 2011 expense , to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for 2012 .",
            "the decrease in the expected return on assets assumption is primarily related to lower bond yields and updated return assumptions for equities .",
            "unless plan assets and benefit obligations are subject to remeasurement during the year , the expected return on pension assets is based on the fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year .",
            "an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return assumptions would have had the following approximate impacts on pensions : ( $ in millions ) increase ( decrease ) in 2012 expense increase ( decrease ) in december 31 , 2011 obligations ."
