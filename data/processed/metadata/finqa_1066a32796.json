            "is&gs 2019 operating profit decreased $ 60 million , or 8% ( 8 % ) , for 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "the decrease was primarily attributable to the activities mentioned above for sales , lower risk retirements and reserves recorded on an international program , partially offset by severance recoveries related to the restructuring announced in november 2013 of approximately $ 20 million for 2014 .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "2013 compared to 2012 is&gs 2019 net sales decreased $ 479 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , for 2013 compared to 2012 .",
            "the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of about $ 495 million due to decreased volume on various programs ( command and control programs for classified customers , ngi and eram programs ) ; and approximately $ 320 million due to the completion of certain programs ( such as total information processing support services , the transportation worker identification credential and the outsourcing desktop initiative for nasa ) .",
            "the decrease was partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 340 million due to the start-up of certain programs ( such as the disa gsm-o and the national science foundation antarctic support ) .",
            "is&gs 2019 operating profit decreased $ 49 million , or 6% ( 6 % ) , for 2013 compared to 2012 .",
            "the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 55 million due to certain programs nearing the end of their life cycles , partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 15 million due to the start-up of certain programs .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were comparable for 2013 compared to 2012 .",
            "backlog backlog increased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to several multi-year international awards and various u.s .",
            "multi-year extensions .",
            "this increase was partially offset by declining activities on various direct warfighter support and command and control programs impacted by defense budget reductions .",
            "backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to lower orders on several programs ( such as eram and ngi ) , higher sales on certain programs ( the national science foundation antarctic support and the disa gsm-o ) and declining activities on several smaller programs primarily due to the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets .",
            "trends we expect is&gs 2019 net sales to decline in 2015 in the low to mid single digit percentage range as compared to 2014 , primarily driven by the continued downturn in federal information technology budgets , an increasingly competitive environment , including the disaggregation of existing contracts , and new contract award delays , partially offset by increased sales resulting from acquisitions that occurred during the year .",
            "operating profit is expected to decline in the low double digit percentage range in 2015 primarily driven by volume and an increase in intangible amortization from 2014 acquisition activity , resulting in 2015 margins that are lower than 2014 results .",
