            "when that timing does not correspond to a published high-quality bond rate , our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate .",
            "the yields on the bonds are used to derive a discount rate for the liability .",
            "the term of our obligation , based on the expected retirement dates of our workforce , is approximately eight years .",

            "the intent of this strategy is to minimize plan expenses by outperforming plan liabilities over the long run .",
