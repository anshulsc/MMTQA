            "the adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs which were previously netted against schlumberger 2019s postretirement benefit plans 2019 funded status in the consolidated balance sheet pursuant to the provisions of sfas 87 ( employers 2019 accounting for pensions ) and sfas 106 ( employer 2019s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions ) .",
