            "troubled debt restructurings ( tdrs ) a tdr is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties .",
            "tdrs result from our loss mitigation activities , and include rate reductions , principal forgiveness , postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization , and extensions , which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral .",
            "additionally , tdrs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to pnc .",
            "in those situations where principal is forgiven , the amount of such principal forgiveness is immediately charged off .",
            "some tdrs may not ultimately result in the full collection of principal and interest , as restructured , and result in potential incremental losses .",
            "these potential incremental losses have been factored into our overall alll estimate .",
            "the level of any subsequent defaults will likely be affected by future economic conditions .",
            "once a loan becomes a tdr , it will continue to be reported as a tdr until it is ultimately repaid in full , the collateral is foreclosed upon , or it is fully charged off .",
            "we held specific reserves in the alll of $ .5 billion and $ .6 billion at december 31 , 2013 and december 31 , 2012 , respectively , for the total tdr portfolio .",
