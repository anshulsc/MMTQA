            "to determine stock-based compensation expense , the grant- date fair value is applied to the options granted with a reduction for estimated forfeitures .",
            "we recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the pro rata vesting period .",
            "at december 31 , 2011 and 2010 , options for 12337000 and 13397000 shares of common stock were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 106.08 and $ 118.21 , respectively .",
            "the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 37 million , $ 4 million and $ 5 million .",
            "cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 118 million , $ 41 million and $ 15 million , respectively .",
            "the actual tax benefit realized for tax deduction purposes from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was approximately $ 41 million , $ 14 million and $ 5 million , respectively .",
            "there were no options granted in excess of market value in 2012 , 2011 or 2010 .",
            "shares of common stock available during the next year for the granting of options and other awards under the incentive plans were 29192854 at december 31 , 2012 .",
            "total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 30537674 shares at december 31 , 2012 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans and the employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) as described below .",
            "during 2012 , we issued approximately 1.7 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity .",

            "awards granted to non-employee directors in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 include 25620 , 27090 and 29040 deferred stock units , respectively , awarded under the outside directors deferred stock unit plan .",
            "a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment until such awards are paid to the participants as cash .",
            "as there are no vesting or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on awarded deferred stock units on the date of grant .",
            "incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant .",
            "the value of certain incentive/ performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period .",
            "the personnel and compensation committee of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards .",
            "restricted stock/unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months .",
            "beginning in 2012 , we incorporated several risk-related performance changes to certain incentive compensation programs .",
            "in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics relative to our peers , the final payout amount will be subject to a negative adjustment if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement .",
            "however , the p&cc has the discretion to reduce any or all of this negative adjustment under certain circumstances .",
            "these awards have a three-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash .",
            "additionally , performance-based restricted share units were granted in 2012 to certain of our executives in lieu of stock options , with generally the same terms and conditions as the 2011 awards of the same .",
            "the weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2012 , 2011 and 2010 was $ 60.68 , $ 63.25 and $ 54.59 per share , respectively .",
