            "we recognize compensation expense for stock options on a straight-line basis over the specified vesting period .",
            "at december 31 , 2012 and 2011 , options for 12759000 and 12337000 shares of common stock were exercisable at a weighted-average price of $ 90.86 and $ 106.08 , respectively .",
            "the total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was $ 86 million , $ 37 million and $ 4 million , respectively .",
            "the total tax benefit recognized related to compensation expense on all share-based payment arrangements during 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was approximately $ 56 million , $ 37 million and $ 38 million , respectively .",
            "cash received from option exercises under all incentive plans for 2013 , 2012 and 2011 was approximately $ 208 million , $ 118 million and $ 41 million , respectively .",

            "total shares of pnc common stock authorized for future issuance under equity compensation plans totaled 25712719 shares at december 31 , 2013 , which includes shares available for issuance under the incentive plans and the employee stock purchase plan ( espp ) as described below .",
            "during 2013 , we issued approximately 2.6 million shares from treasury stock in connection with stock option exercise activity .",

            "a deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which is accounted for as a liability until such awards are paid to the participants in cash .",

            "restricted stock/share unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 3 years to 5 years .",
            "beginning in 2013 , we incorporated several enhanced risk- related performance changes to certain long-term incentive compensation programs .",
            "in addition to achieving certain financial performance metrics on both an absolute basis and relative to our peers , final payout amounts will be subject to reduction if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics as specified in the award agreement .",
            "however , the p&cc has the discretion to waive any or all of this reduction under certain circumstances .",
            "these awards have either a three- year or a four-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash .",
            "additionally , performance-based restricted share units were granted in 2013 to certain executives as part of annual bonus deferral criteria .",
            "these units , payable solely in stock , vest ratably over a four-year period and contain the same risk- related discretionary criteria noted in the preceding paragraph .",
