            "in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated reporting unit fair values , the company reconciles the aggregate fair values of its reporting units determined , as described above , to its current market capitalization , allowing for a reasonable control premium .",
            "if the carrying amount of a reporting unit , calculated using the above approaches , exceeds the reporting unit 2019s fair value , the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss .",
