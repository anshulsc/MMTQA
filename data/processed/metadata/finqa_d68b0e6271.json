            "decreased production volume as final aircraft deliveries were completed during the second quarter of 2012 and $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter during the second quarter of 2012 ; and about $ 270 million for various other programs ( primarily sustainment activities ) due to decreased volume .",
            "the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 295 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; approximately $ 245 million for the c-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries ( six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012 ) and other modernization activities ; and about $ 70 million for the f-35 development contract due to increased volume .",
            "aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2013 decreased $ 87 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2012 .",
            "the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 85 million for the f-22 program , which includes approximately $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $ 35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume ; approximately $ 70 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities ; about $ 65 million for the c-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements ; approximately $ 35 million for the f-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix .",
            "the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 180 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume .",
            "operating profit was comparable for the f-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $ 85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012 .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 75 million lower for 2013 compared to backlog backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on f-16 and f-22 programs .",
            "backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program .",
            "trends we expect aeronautics 2019 2015 net sales to be comparable or slightly behind 2014 due to a decline in f-16 deliveries as well as a decline in f-35 development activity , partially offset by an increase in production contracts .",
            "operating profit is also expected to decrease in the low single digit range , due primarily to contract mix , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between years .",

            "is&gs has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies 2019 information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price .",
