            "in connection with these restatements , management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to the misapplication of accounting standards update 2016-15 .",

            "if other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control are discovered or occur in the future or we otherwise must restate our financial statements , it could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition , restrict our ability to access the capital markets , require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies , subject us to fines , penalties , investigations or judgments , harm our reputation , or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence .",
