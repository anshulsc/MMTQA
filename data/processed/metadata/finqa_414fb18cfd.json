            "on a regular basis our special asset committee closely monitors loans , primarily commercial loans , that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower 2019s ability to comply with existing repayment terms .",
            "these loans totaled $ .2 billion at both december 31 , 2014 and december 31 , 2013 .",
            "home equity loan portfolio our home equity loan portfolio totaled $ 34.7 billion as of december 31 , 2014 , or 17% ( 17 % ) of the total loan portfolio .",
            "of that total , $ 20.4 billion , or 59% ( 59 % ) , was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $ 14.3 billion , or 41% ( 41 % ) , consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans .",
            "approximately 3% ( 3 % ) of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of december 31 , 2014 .",
            "as of december 31 , 2014 , we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 51% ( 51 % ) of the total portfolio and , where originated as a second lien , we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% ( 2 % ) of the portfolio .",
            "the remaining 47% ( 47 % ) of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position .",
            "the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien .",
            "lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination .",
            "however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied .",
            "therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien .",
            "additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien .",
            "this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources .",
            "we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold .",
            "this information is used for internal reporting and risk management .",
            "for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) .",
            "as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) .",
            "in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans .",
            "in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses .",
            "the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off .",
            "the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool .",
            "each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens .",
            "our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans .",
            "generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term .",
            "during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest .",
            "we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments .",
            "the risk associated with the borrower 2019s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll .",
            "based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2014 , the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end .",
