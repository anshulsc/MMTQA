            "in connection with our long-term outsourcing service agreements , highly customized implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems and operating processes .",
            "for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting , specific , incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services commencing are generally deferred and amortized over the period that the related ongoing services revenue is recognized .",
            "deferred costs are assessed for recoverability on a periodic basis to the extent the deferred cost exceeds related deferred revenue .",
            "pensions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world .",
            "our most significant plans are located in the u.s. , the u.k. , the netherlands and canada .",
            "our significant u.s. , u.k. , netherlands and canadian pension plans are closed to new entrants .",
            "we have ceased crediting future benefits relating to salary and service for our u.s. , u.k. , netherlands and canadian plans to the extent statutorily permitted .",
            "in 2016 , we estimate pension and post-retirement net periodic benefit cost for major plans to increase by $ 15 million to a benefit of approximately $ 54 million .",
            "the increase in the benefit is primarily due to a change in our approach to measuring service and interest cost .",
            "effective december 31 , 2015 and for 2016 expense , we have elected to utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost for our major pension and other post-retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows .",
            "in 2015 and prior years , we estimated these components of net periodic pension and post-retirement benefit cost by applying a single weighted-average discount rate , derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period .",
            "we have made this change to improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and the corresponding yield curve spot rates and to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs .",
            "this change does not affect the measurement of the projected benefit obligation as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial ( gain ) loss recorded in other comprehensive income .",
            "we accounted for this change as a change in estimate and , accordingly , will account for it prospectively .",
            "recognition of gains and losses and prior service certain changes in the value of the obligation and in the value of plan assets , which may occur due to various factors such as changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions , actual demographic experience and/or plan asset performance are not immediately recognized in net income .",
            "such changes are recognized in other comprehensive income and are amortized into net income as part of the net periodic benefit cost .",
            "unrecognized gains and losses that have been deferred in other comprehensive income , as previously described , are amortized into compensation and benefits expense as a component of periodic pension expense based on the average life expectancy of the u.s. , the netherlands , canada , and u.k .",
            "plan members .",
            "we amortize any prior service expense or credits that arise as a result of plan changes over a period consistent with the amortization of gains and losses .",
            "as of december 31 , 2015 , our pension plans have deferred losses that have not yet been recognized through income in the consolidated financial statements .",
            "we amortize unrecognized actuarial losses outside of a corridor , which is defined as 10% ( 10 % ) of the greater of market-related value of plan assets or projected benefit obligation .",
            "to the extent not offset by future gains , incremental amortization as calculated above will continue to affect future pension expense similarly until fully amortized .",
            "the following table discloses our unrecognized actuarial gains and losses , the number of years over which we are amortizing the experience loss , and the estimated 2016 amortization of loss by country ( amounts in millions ) : ."
