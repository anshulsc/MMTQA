            "liquidity monitoring and measurement stress testing liquidity stress testing is performed for each of citi 2019s major entities , operating subsidiaries and/or countries .",
            "stress testing and scenario analyses are intended to quantify the potential impact of an adverse liquidity event on the balance sheet and liquidity position , and to identify viable funding alternatives that can be utilized .",
            "these scenarios include assumptions about significant changes in key funding sources , market triggers ( such as credit ratings ) , potential uses of funding and geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions .",
            "these conditions include expected and stressed market conditions as well as company-specific events .",
            "liquidity stress tests are conducted to ascertain potential mismatches between liquidity sources and uses over a variety of time horizons and over different stressed conditions .",
            "liquidity limits are set accordingly .",
            "to monitor the liquidity of an entity , these stress tests and potential mismatches are calculated with varying frequencies , with several tests performed daily .",
            "given the range of potential stresses , citi maintains contingency funding plans on a consolidated basis and for individual entities .",
            "these plans specify a wide range of readily available actions for a variety of adverse market conditions or idiosyncratic stresses .",
            "short-term liquidity measurement : liquidity coverage ratio ( lcr ) in addition to internal liquidity stress metrics that citi has developed for a 30-day stress scenario , citi also monitors its liquidity by reference to the lcr , as calculated pursuant to the u.s .",
            "lcr rules .",
            "generally , the lcr is designed to ensure that banks maintain an adequate level of hqla to meet liquidity needs under an acute 30-day stress scenario .",
            "the lcr is calculated by dividing hqla by estimated net outflows over a stressed 30-day period , with the net outflows determined by applying prescribed outflow factors to various categories of liabilities , such as deposits , unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings , unused lending commitments and derivatives- related exposures , partially offset by inflows from assets maturing within 30 days .",
            "banks are required to calculate an add-on to address potential maturity mismatches between contractual cash outflows and inflows within the 30-day period in determining the total amount of net outflows .",
            "the minimum lcr requirement is 100% ( 100 % ) , effective january 2017 .",
            "pursuant to the federal reserve board 2019s final rule regarding lcr disclosures , effective april 1 , 2017 , citi began to disclose lcr in the prescribed format .",
