            "the nmb will have to determine that a single transportation system exists and will certify a post-merger representative of the combined employee groups before the process for negotiating new jcbas can begin .",

            "for those employees , the rla provides that cbas do not expire , but instead become amendable as of a stated date .",
            "in 2014 , envoy pilots ratified a new 10 year collective bargaining agreement , piedmont pilots ratified a new 10 year collective bargaining agreement and piedmont flight attendants ratified a new five-year collective bargaining agreement .",
            "with the exception of the passenger service employees who are now engaged in traditional rla negotiations that are expected to result in a jcba and the us airways flight simulator engineers and flight crew training instructors , other union-represented american mainline employees are covered by agreements that are not currently amendable .",
            "until those agreements become amendable , negotiations for jcbas will be conducted outside the traditional rla bargaining process described above , and , in the meantime , no self-help will be permissible .",
