            "the results of the first step of the impairment test showed no indication of impairment in any of the reporting units at any of the periods except december 31 , 2008 and , accordingly , the company did not perform the second step of the impairment test , except for the test performed as of december 31 , 2008 .",
            "as of december 31 , 2008 , there was an indication of impairment in the north america consumer banking , latin america consumer banking and emea consumer banking reporting units and , accordingly , the second step of testing was performed on these reporting units .",
            "based on the results of the second step of testing , the company recorded a $ 9.6 billion pretax ( $ 8.7 billion after tax ) goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2008 , representing the entire amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units .",
            "the primary cause for the goodwill impairment in the above reporting units was the rapid deterioration in the financial markets , as well as in the global economic outlook particularly during the period beginning mid-november through year end 2008 .",
            "this deterioration further weakened the near-term prospects for the financial services industry .",
            "these and other factors , including the increased possibility of further government intervention , also resulted in the decline in the company 2019s market capitalization from approximately $ 90 billion at july 1 , 2008 and approximately $ 74 billion at october 31 , 2008 to approximately $ 36 billion at december 31 , 2008 .",

            "the adjustments to measure the assets , liabilities and intangibles were for the purpose of measuring the implied fair value of goodwill and such adjustments are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet .",
