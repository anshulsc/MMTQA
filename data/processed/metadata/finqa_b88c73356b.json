            "interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year .",

            "on november 1 , 2011 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $ 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval .",
            "the facility matures november 1 , 2017 .",
            "as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2015 and 2014 , we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility .",

            "changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility .",
            "under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants .",
            "these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio .",
            "in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable .",

            "we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future .",
