            "the fuel consumption rate ( c-rate ) , computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles in thousands , increased 1% ( 1 % ) compared to 2014 .",
            "decreases in heavier , more fuel-efficient shipments , decreased gross-ton miles and increased the c-rate .",
            "volume growth of 7% ( 7 % ) , as measured by gross ton-miles , drove the increase in fuel expense in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "this was essentially offset by lower locomotive diesel fuel prices , which averaged $ 2.97 per gallon ( including taxes and transportation costs ) in 2014 , compared to $ 3.15 in 2013 , along with a slight improvement in c-rate , computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles .",
            "depreciation 2013 the majority of depreciation relates to road property , including rail , ties , ballast , and other track material .",
            "a higher depreciable asset base , reflecting higher capital spending in recent years , increased depreciation expense in 2015 compared to 2014 .",
            "this increase was partially offset by our recent depreciation studies that resulted in lower depreciation rates for some asset classes .",
            "depreciation was up 7% ( 7 % ) in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "a higher depreciable asset base , reflecting higher ongoing capital spending drove the increase .",
            "equipment and other rents 2013 equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies ; freight car , intermodal , and locomotive leases ; and office and other rent expenses .",
            "equipment and other rents expense decreased $ 4 million compared to 2014 primarily from a decrease in manifest and intermodal shipments , partially offset by growth in finished vehicle shipments .",
            "higher intermodal volumes and longer cycle times increased short-term freight car rental expense in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
            "lower equipment leases essentially offset the higher freight car rental expense , as we exercised purchase options on some of our leased equipment .",
            "other 2013 other expenses include state and local taxes , freight , equipment and property damage , utilities , insurance , personal injury , environmental , employee travel , telephone and cellular , computer software , bad debt , and other general expenses .",
            "other expenses were flat in 2015 compared to 2014 as higher property taxes were offset by lower costs in other areas .",
            "higher property taxes , personal injury expense and utilities costs partially offset by lower environmental expense and costs associated with damaged freight resulted in an increase in other costs in 2014 compared to 2013 .",
