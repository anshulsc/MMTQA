            "aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2011 increased $ 132 million , or 9% ( 9 % ) , compared to 2010 .",
            "the increase primarily was attributable to approximately $ 115 million of higher operating profit on c-130 programs due to increased volume and the retirement of risks ; increased volume and risk retirements on f-16 programs of about $ 50 million and c-5 programs of approximately $ 20 million ; and about $ 70 million due to risk retirements on other aeronautics sustainment activities in 2011 .",
            "these increases partially were offset by a decline in operating profit of approximately $ 75 million on the f-22 program and f-35 development contract primarily due to lower volume and about $ 55 million on other programs , including f-35 lrip , primarily due to lower profit rate adjustments in 2011 compared to 2010 .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit rate adjustments described above , were approximately $ 90 million higher in 2011 compared to 2010 .",
            "backlog backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 contracts and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs .",
            "backlog increased in 2011 compared to 2010 mainly due to higher orders on f-35 contracts , which partially were offset by higher sales volume on the c-130 programs .",
            "trends we expect aeronautics will experience a mid single digit percentage range decline in net sales for 2013 as compared to 2012 .",
            "a decrease in net sales from a decline in f-16 and c-130j aircraft deliveries is expected to be partially offset by an increase in net sales volume on f-35 lrip contracts .",
            "operating profit is projected to decrease at a high single digit percentage range from 2012 levels due to the expected decline in net sales as well as changes in aircraft mix , resulting in a slight decline in operating margins between the years .",
