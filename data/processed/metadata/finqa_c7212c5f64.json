            "2015 compared to 2014 mfc 2019s net sales in 2015 decreased $ 322 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to the same period in 2014 .",
            "the decrease was attributable to lower net sales of approximately $ 345 million for air and missile defense programs due to fewer deliveries ( primarily pac-3 ) and lower volume ( primarily thaad ) ; and approximately $ 85 million for tactical missile programs due to fewer deliveries ( primarily guided multiple launch rocket system ( gmlrs ) ) and joint air-to-surface standoff missile , partially offset by increased deliveries for hellfire .",
            "these decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of approximately $ 55 million for energy solutions programs due to increased volume .",
            "mfc 2019s operating profit in 2015 decreased $ 62 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2014 .",
            "the decrease was attributable to lower operating profit of approximately $ 100 million for fire control programs due primarily to lower risk retirements ( primarily lantirn and sniper ) ; and approximately $ 65 million for tactical missile programs due to lower risk retirements ( primarily hellfire and gmlrs ) and fewer deliveries .",
            "these decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 75 million for air and missile defense programs due to increased risk retirements ( primarily thaad ) .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 60 million lower in 2015 compared to 2014 .",
            "backlog backlog decreased in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to lower orders on pac-3 , hellfire , and jassm .",
            "backlog increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to higher orders on pac-3 , lantirn/sniper and certain tactical missile programs , partially offset by lower orders on thaad .",
            "trends we expect mfc 2019s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 as compared to 2016 driven primarily by our air and missile defense programs .",
            "operating profit is expected to be flat or increase slightly .",
            "accordingly , operating profit margin is expected to decline from 2016 levels as a result of contract mix and fewer risk retirements in 2017 compared to 2016 .",
            "rotary and mission systems as previously described , on november 6 , 2015 , we acquired sikorsky and aligned the sikorsky business under our rms business segment .",
            "the 2015 results of the acquired sikorsky business have been included in our financial results from the november 6 , 2015 acquisition date through december 31 , 2015 .",
            "as a result , our consolidated operating results and rms business segment operating results for the year ended december 31 , 2015 do not reflect a full year of sikorsky operations .",
            "our rms business segment provides design , manufacture , service and support for a variety of military and civil helicopters , ship and submarine mission and combat systems ; mission systems and sensors for rotary and fixed-wing aircraft ; sea and land-based missile defense systems ; radar systems ; the littoral combat ship ( lcs ) ; simulation and training services ; and unmanned systems and technologies .",
            "in addition , rms supports the needs of government customers in cybersecurity and delivers communication and command and control capabilities through complex mission solutions for defense applications .",
