            "to our knowledge , we are in compliance with all material requirements associated with the various regulations .",
            "the united states congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases , including carbon dioxide and methane .",
            "in addition , state and regional initiatives to regulate greenhouse gas emissions are underway .",
            "we are monitoring federal and state legislation to assess the potential impact on our operations .",
            "our most recent calculation of direct greenhouse gas emissions for oneok and oneok partners is estimated to be less than 6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents on an annual basis .",
            "we will continue efforts to quantify our direct greenhouse gas emissions and will report such emissions as required by any mandatory reporting rule , including the rules anticipated to be issued by the epa in mid-2009 .",
            "superfund - the comprehensive environmental response , compensation and liability act , also known as cercla or superfund , imposes liability , without regard to fault or the legality of the original act , on certain classes of persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment .",
            "these persons include the owner or operator of a facility where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the facility .",
            "under cercla , these persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances released into the environment , damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies .",

            "we completed the homeland security assessments and our facilities were subsequently assigned to one of four risk-based tiers ranging from high ( tier 1 ) to low ( tier 4 ) risk , or not tiered at all due to low risk .",
            "a majority of our facilities were not tiered .",
            "we are waiting for homeland security 2019s analysis to determine if any of the tiered facilities will require site security plans and possible physical security enhancements .",

            "these strategies include : ( i ) developing and maintaining an accurate greenhouse gas emissions inventory , according to rules anticipated to be issued by the epa in mid-2009 ; ( ii ) improving the efficiency of our various pipelines , natural gas processing facilities and natural gas liquids fractionation facilities ; ( iii ) following developing technologies for emission control ; ( iv ) following developing technologies to capture carbon dioxide to keep it from reaching the atmosphere ; and ( v ) analyzing options for future energy investment .",
            "currently , certain subsidiaries of oneok partners participate in the processing and transmission sectors and ldcs in our distribution segment participate in the distribution sector of the epa 2019s natural gas star program to voluntarily reduce methane emissions .",
