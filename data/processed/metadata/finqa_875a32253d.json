            "in addition , we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as airtel , telef f3nica s.a .",
            "and vodafone group plc .",
            "we believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward .",
            "in emerging markets , such as ghana , india , nigeria and uganda , wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the united states , and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas .",
            "a majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services , predominantly on feature phones , while advanced device penetration remains low .",
            "in more developed urban locations within these markets , early-stage data network deployments are underway .",
            "carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate .",
            "in markets with rapidly evolving network technology , such as south africa and most of the countries in latin america where we do business , initial voice networks , for the most part , have already been built out , and carriers are focused on 3g network build outs , with select investments in 4g technology .",
            "consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices , and as a result , the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially .",
            "recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks .",
            "smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly , which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service .",
            "finally , in markets with more mature network technology , such as germany , carriers are focused on deploying 4g data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage amongst their customer base .",
            "with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage , carrier investment in networks is focused on 4g coverage and capacity .",
            "we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united states , which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years , will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets .",
            "as a result , we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 60190 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable , long-term growth .",
            "we have holistic master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent , long-term revenue and a reduction in the likelihood of churn .",
            "our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced collocation cycle times , thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites .",

            "during the year ended december 31 , 2015 , we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 25370 sites .",
            "in a majority of our asia , emea and latin america markets , the acquisition or construction of new sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass- through revenues ( such as ground rent or power and fuel costs ) and expenses .",
            "we continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios , both domestically and internationally , to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio. ."
