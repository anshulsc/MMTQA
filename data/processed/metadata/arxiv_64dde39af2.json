HIV-4, VADER, and LMD are lexicon-based baselines. FinBERT and FinLlama are SFT classification LLMs, while Instruct-FinGPT, FinGPT v3.3 and FinSFT are instruction-tuned causal LLMs. FinDPO is our proposed DPO-aligned causal LLM. FinBERT is excluded from evaluation on FPB due to data leakage, as it was originally trained on the full FPB dataset."
