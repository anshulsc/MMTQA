            "discounted cash flow model ( dcf ) to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment , as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value .",
            "a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast operating cash flows , including sales growth ( volumes and pricing ) , production costs , capital spending , and discount rate .",
            "most of these assumptions vary significantly among the reporting units .",
            "cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years .",
            "the wacc rate for the individual reporting units is estimated with the assistance of valuation experts .",
            "arconic would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit 2019s fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit .",
            "in connection with the interim impairment evaluation of long-lived assets for the disks operations ( an asset group within the aen business unit ) in the second quarter of 2018 , which resulted from a decline in forecasted financial performance for the business in connection with its updated three-year strategic plan , the company also performed an interim impairment evaluation of goodwill for the aen reporting unit .",
            "the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was substantially in excess of the carrying value ; thus , there was no impairment of goodwill .",
            "goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2016 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company 2019s reporting units , except for the arconic forgings and extrusions ( afe ) business whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value .",
            "as such , arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of $ 719 .",
            "the decrease in the afe fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return , while the carrying value increased compared to prior year .",
