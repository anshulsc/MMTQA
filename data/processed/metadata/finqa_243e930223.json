            "the decrease was due to paydowns and charge-offs on delinquent loans , partially offset by the addition of loans as a result of the adoption of the accounting guidance related to vies .",
            "late-stage delinquencies remained elevated but continued to improve , albeit at a slower rate during the second half of the year , while early-stage delinquencies stabilized at an elevated level during this period .",
            "nonaccrual loans improved largely as a result of the improvement in late-stage delinquencies .",

            "provision expense de- creased due to favorable loss severity as a result of a strong used- car market nationwide and reduced loss frequency due to the tightening of underwriting criteria in earlier periods .",

            "business banking : business banking loans at december 31 , 2010 , were $ 16.8 billion , compared with $ 17.0 billion at december 31 , 2009 .",
            "the decrease was primarily a result of run-off of the washington mutual portfolio and charge-offs on delinquent loans .",

            "nonaccrual loans continued to remain elevated .",

            "probable decreases in expected loan principal cash flows would trigger the recognition of impairment through the provision for loan losses .",
            "probable and significant increases in expected cash flows ( e.g. , decreased principal credit losses , the net benefit of modifications ) would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan losses , with any remaining increase in the expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated lives of the underlying loans .",
            "during 2010 , management concluded as part of the firm 2019s regular assessment of the pci pools that it was probable that higher expected principal credit losses would result in a decrease in expected cash flows .",

            "approximately 50% ( 50 % ) of current borrowers are subject to risk of payment shock due to future payment recast ; substantially all of the remaining loans have been modified to a fixed rate fully amortizing loan .",
            "the cumulative amount of unpaid interest added to the unpaid principal balance of the option arm pci pool was $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.9 billion at de- cember 31 , 2010 and 2009 , respectively .",
