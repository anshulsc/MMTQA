            "aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2012 increased $ 69 million , or 4% ( 4 % ) , compared to 2011 .",
            "the increase was attributable to higher operating profit of approximately $ 105 million from c-130 programs due to an increase in risk retirements ; about $ 50 million from f-16 programs due to higher aircraft deliveries partially offset by a decline in risk retirements ; approximately $ 50 million from f-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; and about $ 50 million from the completion of purchased intangible asset amortization on certain f-16 contracts .",
            "partially offsetting the increases was lower operating profit of about $ 90 million from the f-35 development contract primarily due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the second quarter of 2012 ; approximately $ 50 million from decreased production volume and risk retirements on the f-22 program partially offset by a resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 ; and approximately $ 45 million primarily due to a decrease in risk retirements on other sustainment activities partially offset by various other aeronautics programs due to increased risk retirements and volume .",
            "operating profit for c-5 programs was comparable to 2011 .",
            "adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters described above , were approximately $ 30 million lower for 2012 compared to 2011 .",
            "backlog backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 , and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program .",
            "backlog decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 mainly due to lower orders on f-35 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on f-16 programs .",
            "trends we expect aeronautics 2019 net sales to increase in 2014 in the mid-single digit percentage range as compared to 2013 primarily due to an increase in net sales from f-35 production contracts .",
            "operating profit is expected to increase slightly from 2013 , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between the years due to program mix .",
