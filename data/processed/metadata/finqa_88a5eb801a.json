            "indemnification and repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases ; however , on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors .",
            "in connection with pooled settlements , we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction .",
            "for the first and second-lien mortgage balances of unresolved and settled claims contained in the tables below , a significant amount of these claims were associated with sold loans originated through correspondent lender and broker origination channels .",
            "in certain instances when indemnification or repurchase claims are settled for these types of sold loans , we have recourse back to the correspondent lenders , brokers and other third-parties ( e.g. , contract underwriting companies , closing agents , appraisers , etc. ) .",
            "depending on the underlying reason for the investor claim , we determine our ability to pursue recourse with these parties and file claims with them accordingly .",
            "our historical recourse recovery rate has been insignificant as our efforts have been impacted by the inability of such parties to reimburse us for their recourse obligations ( e.g. , their capital availability or whether they remain in business ) or factors that limit our ability to pursue recourse from these parties ( e.g. , contractual loss caps , statutes of limitations ) .",
            "origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity , and , accordingly , management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements .",
            "we establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased .",
            "for the first and second- lien mortgage sold portfolio , we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made , demand patterns observed to date and/or expected in the future , and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis .",
            "to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties , we consider the following factors : ( i ) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio ( both actual and estimated future defaults ) , ( ii ) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims , ( iii ) estimated probable future repurchase claims , considering information about file requests , delinquent and liquidated loans , resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions , ( iv ) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims ( 201crescission rate 201d ) , and ( v ) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral , make-whole settlement , or indemnification .",
