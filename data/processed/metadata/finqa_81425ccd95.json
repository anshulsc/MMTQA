            "/ 2008 annual report the allowance for credit losses increased $ 13.7 billion from the prior year to $ 23.8 billion .",
            "the increase included $ 4.1 billion of allowance related to noncredit-impaired loans acquired in the washington mutual transaction and the related accounting conformity provision .",
            "excluding held-for-sale loans , loans carried at fair value , and pur- chased credit-impaired consumer loans , the allowance for loan losses represented 3.62% ( 3.62 % ) of loans at december 31 , 2008 , compared with 1.88% ( 1.88 % ) at december 31 , 2007 .",
            "the consumer allowance for loan losses increased $ 10.5 billion from the prior year as a result of the washington mutual transaction and increased allowance for loan loss in residential real estate and credit card .",
            "the increase included additions to the allowance for loan losses of $ 4.7 billion driven by higher estimated losses for residential mort- gage and home equity loans as the weak labor market and weak overall economic conditions have resulted in increased delinquencies , while continued weak housing prices have driven a significant increase in loss severity .",
            "the allowance for loan losses related to credit card increased $ 4.3 billion from the prior year primarily due to the acquired allowance and subsequent conforming provision for loan loss related to the washington mutual bank acquisition and an increase in provision for loan losses of $ 2.3 billion in 2008 over 2007 , as higher estimated net charge-offs are expected in the port- folio resulting from the current economic conditions .",
            "the wholesale allowance for loan losses increase of $ 3.4 billion from december 31 , 2007 , reflected the effect of a weakening credit envi- ronment and the transfer of $ 4.9 billion of funded and unfunded leveraged lending commitments to retained loans from held-for-sale .",
            "to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the firm 2019s process of extending credit , an allowance for lending-related commitments is held for both wholesale and consumer , which is reported in other lia- bilities .",
            "the wholesale component is computed using a methodology similar to that used for the wholesale loan portfolio , modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown and has an asset- specific component and a formula-based component .",
            "for a further discussion on the allowance for lending-related commitment see note 15 on pages 178 2013180 of this annual report .",
            "the allowance for lending-related commitments for both wholesale and consumer was $ 659 million and $ 850 million at december 31 , 2008 and 2007 , respectively .",
            "the decrease reflects the reduction in lending-related commitments at december 31 , 2008 .",
