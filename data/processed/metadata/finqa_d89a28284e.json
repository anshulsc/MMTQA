            "this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in expenses that do not have a corresponding cash outflow , such as depreciation and amortization , as a percentage of total net income .",
            "cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended june 2008 was $ 102148 and includes payments for acquisitions of $ 48109 , plus $ 1215 in contingent consideration paid on prior years 2019 acquisitions .",

            "cash used in financing activities was partially offset by proceeds of $ 20394 from the exercise of stock options and the sale of common stock and $ 3809 excess tax benefits from stock option exercises .",
            "during fiscal 2007 , net cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of our common stock for $ 98413 and the payment of dividends of $ 21685 .",

            "at june 30 , 2008 , the company had negative working capital of $ 11418 ; however , the largest component of current liabilities was deferred revenue of $ 212375 .",
            "the cash outlay necessary to provide the services related to these deferred revenues is significantly less than this recorded balance .",
