            "notes to consolidated financial statements hedge accounting the firm applies hedge accounting for ( i ) certain interest rate swaps used to manage the interest rate exposure of certain fixed-rate unsecured long-term and short-term borrowings and certain fixed-rate certificates of deposit , ( ii ) certain foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt used to manage foreign currency exposures on the firm 2019s net investment in certain non-u.s .",
            "operations and ( iii ) certain commodities-related swap and forward contracts used to manage the exposure to the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sales of certain energy commodities by one of the firm 2019s consolidated investments .",
            "to qualify for hedge accounting , the derivative hedge must be highly effective at reducing the risk from the exposure being hedged .",
            "additionally , the firm must formally document the hedging relationship at inception and test the hedging relationship at least on a quarterly basis to ensure the derivative hedge continues to be highly effective over the life of the hedging relationship .",
            "fair value hedges the firm designates certain interest rate swaps as fair value hedges .",
            "these interest rate swaps hedge changes in fair value attributable to the designated benchmark interest rate ( e.g. , london interbank offered rate ( libor ) or ois ) , effectively converting a substantial portion of fixed-rate obligations into floating-rate obligations .",
            "the firm applies a statistical method that utilizes regression analysis when assessing the effectiveness of its fair value hedging relationships in achieving offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedging instrument and the risk being hedged ( i.e. , interest rate risk ) .",
            "an interest rate swap is considered highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value attributable to changes in the hedged risk when the regression analysis results in a coefficient of determination of 80% ( 80 % ) or greater and a slope between 80% ( 80 % ) and 125% ( 125 % ) .",
            "for qualifying fair value hedges , gains or losses on derivatives are included in 201cinterest expense . 201d the change in fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged is reported as an adjustment to its carrying value and is subsequently amortized into interest expense over its remaining life .",
            "gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are included in 201cinterest expense . 201d when a derivative is no longer designated as a hedge , any remaining difference between the carrying value and par value of the hedged item is amortized to interest expense over the remaining life of the hedged item using the effective interest method .",
            "see note 23 for further information about interest income and interest expense .",
            "the table below presents the gains/ ( losses ) from interest rate derivatives accounted for as hedges , the related hedged borrowings and bank deposits , and the hedge ineffectiveness on these derivatives , which primarily consists of amortization of prepaid credit spreads resulting from the passage of time. ."
