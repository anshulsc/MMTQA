All four models with 'High' compute (StockFormer, EarnHFT, MacroHFT, HRT) and the one with 'Very High' compute (TRR) are split between 'Direct' (3) and 'Indirect' (2) execution. However, models with 'Medium' or 'Low' compute requirements are predominantly 'Direct' (3 out of 4), with only one using 'Indirect' execution.

In contrast, studies using Statistical and Econometric Models (SEM) tend to have sample sizes in the thousands or high hundreds. Machine Learning (ML) models are applied to the widest range of sample sizes, from as small as 48 to as large as 3.5 million.

          "There is no strong positive correlation, but there is a clear performance hierarchy. On the F1-based tasks, Gemini consistently outperforms or matches GPT 4. For the 'ccfraud' and 'taiwan' datasets, Gemini's scores (0.90 and 0.95) are substantially higher than GPT 4's score (0.55 for both). For 'LendingClub', Gemini (0.65) is still moderately higher than GPT 4 (0.55). Only on the 'MLESG' dataset are their scores nearly identical (0.35 vs 0.34). This suggests that while their performance isn't tightly correlated, Gemini is generally a superior model for these specific F1-measured tasks."

As the weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased steadily from 2000 to 2002, the basic net income fluctuated, peaking in 2001 before dropping to its lowest point in 2002, the year with the highest number of shares. This suggests that as shares increased, income did not necessarily follow, and in fact, the highest share count corresponds to the lowest income."

For instance, Class C (Series II) had over 79 million shares redeemed but no corresponding conversion activity noted. Conversely, Class C (Series IV) had shares converted away from it without significant redemptions. Class C (Series III) is the only one showing both significant redemptions and conversions away from it, but the numbers do not match. This suggests that redemptions and conversions were largely separate transactions rather than a single, combined event for most series."

While assets decreased from $56 billion to $35 billion, deposits grew from $46 billion to $60 billion. This suggests a significant strategic shift away from holding assets towards strengthening the deposit base, possibly to improve liquidity, reduce risk, and focus on core banking activities during a period of financial transformation."

Percentages indicate the relative level of support for a candidate within a single county, making it easy to see who won that specific area. Absolute numbers (vote counts) indicate the scale and overall impact of that win on a larger, aggregate election. Relying only on percentages can be misleading because a high percentage win in a low-population county contributes far fewer total votes than a narrow loss in a high-population county. For example, Kerry's 64.5% win in Jefferson county yielded 19,675 votes, while Bush's larger 65.1% win in Pope county yielded only 13,614 votes, demonstrating that percentage alone does not reflect the total vote contribution."

          "There is no discernible correlation between specific writers and viewership numbers. For example, Jonathan Greene wrote three episodes with varied viewerships: \"Impulsive\" (12.19M), \"Blinded\" (12.49M), and \"Trade\" (10.44M), the last of which is the lowest in the dataset. Similarly, Judith McCreary wrote \"Savant\" (12.54M) and \"Signature\" (15.17M), the latter being the highest viewed episode by a significant margin. This high variance within the work of a single writer suggests that other factors, such as plot, guest stars, or scheduling, likely have a stronger influence on viewership than the writer alone."
