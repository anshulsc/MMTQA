For instance, the class with the highest number of initial shares, 'class usa ( 1 )' (426M), has a conversion ratio below 1.0 (0.93870), resulting in a decrease. In contrast, 'class ap', with the second-highest initial share count (119M), has the highest conversion ratio (1.19043), leading to an increase. Smaller classes like the 'class eu' series have a stable ratio of 1.0. This lack of a consistent trend suggests the conversion ratio is determined by factors other than the initial volume of shares."
