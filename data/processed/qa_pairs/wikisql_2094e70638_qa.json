The one Democratic incumbent who faced a challenger still won re-election, and one lost renomination but the party held the seat. In contrast, the sole Republican incumbent retired, leading to a competitive race. This suggests that Democratic incumbents in these districts were far more likely to secure re-election without opposition than their Republican counterpart."
