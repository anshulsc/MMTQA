        "The horse generally competed in progressively longer races over time. Starting at 1200 m in September 1995, the race distances steadily increased to a peak of 2500 m by November 1995. After a brief return to a shorter distance of 1400 m in February 1996, the distances again increased, culminating in a 2400 m race in March 1996. This indicates a clear trend of testing the horse's stamina over longer distances as its career progressed within this period."
