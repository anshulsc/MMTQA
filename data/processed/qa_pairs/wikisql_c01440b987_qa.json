For example, Katowice Voivodeship has the highest population by a large margin (3,733,900) but only a moderate number of communes (46). In contrast, Kielce Voivodeship has the most communes (69) but a significantly smaller population (1,068,700). Similarly, Warsaw, the second most populous voivodeship (2,319,100), has only 32 communes, which is among the lower values in the table. This lack of a consistent pattern suggests that population size alone did not determine the number of communes in this administrative structure."
