The methods that list multiple LLM models (Multimodal Gen-AI [9], Fine-tuning LLMs [8], [25]) also tend to use multiple, diverse data sources (4, 1, and 4 respectively). Conversely, methods that specify a single LLM often, though not always, use fewer or more focused data sources (e.g., Stock-Chain framework [27] or SAPPO [37]). This suggests that more complex, multi-model approaches may be designed to synthesize information from a wider array of data inputs."
