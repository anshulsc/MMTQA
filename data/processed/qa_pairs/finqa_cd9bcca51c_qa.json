However, the second largest property (414,000 in The Woodlands) has only one, while the third largest (413,000 in Gurgaon) has multiple. This inconsistency, with large properties having both single and multiple expiration dates, indicates that square footage is not a reliable predictor of the number of lease agreements for a property based on this dataset."
