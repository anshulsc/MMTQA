        "Yes, there appears to be a relationship. All seven schools that have different years for their last overall vs. outright championship are among the higher-achieving schools, with an average of 8.4 championships each. In contrast, the five schools where these years are the same have an average of only 3.4 championships. This suggests that schools with a history of winning more championships are more likely to have won shared titles, resulting in a discrepancy between the two dates."
