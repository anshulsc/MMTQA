In contrast, 2009 saw an increase of $137 million, driven overwhelmingly by a large positive 'revisions to previous estimates' of $124 million, which more than compensated for the $65 million in settled liabilities."

        "Yes, there is an observable pattern. The 'accretion expense' appears to be a relatively stable percentage of the starting balance. In 2008, it was 5.8% of the starting balance ($66M / $1134M), and in 2009, it was 6.6% ($64M / $965M). This suggests that the accretion expense is consistently calculated based on the opening obligation, likely reflecting the time value of money on the long-term liability."
