        "Yes, there is a strong inverse relationship. In the first period (row 3), a reclassification out (loss) of $93 million for available-for-sale investments corresponded with a total positive reclassification of $506 million. In the second period (row 8), a reclassification out (loss) of $530 million corresponded with a total negative reclassification of $322 million. In both cases, the significant negative reclassification from this one component heavily influences the total, but other components can drive the total in the opposite direction."
