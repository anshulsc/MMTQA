Similarly, Electronic Arts and Capcom were nominated. However, independent or smaller publishers also show success; D3 Publisher had a win with 'Flushed Away' and Playdead won with 'Limbo', while Double Fine and Quantic Dream received nominations. This indicates that both major and independent publishers are competitive, and success in these awards is not exclusive to large corporations."
