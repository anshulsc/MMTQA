While some of the oldest presidents at inauguration, like Nii Ollennu and Edward Akufo-Addo (both ~64), had long lifespans (80 and 73 years), John A. Mills was also inaugurated at 64 but had a shorter lifespan of 68 years. Conversely, the youngest presidents at inauguration, Jerry Rawlings (31) and Akwasi Afrifa (32), had lifespans of 66 and 43 years respectively, which does not suggest a clear pattern. Therefore, the data does not support a strong correlation between inauguration age and lifespan."
