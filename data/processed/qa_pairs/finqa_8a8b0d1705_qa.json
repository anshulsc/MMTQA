However, there is no clear correlation in their year-over-year changes. For example, from 2005 to 2006, treasury stock purchases decreased slightly while dividends increased slightly. Then from 2006 to 2007, treasury stock purchases increased dramatically while dividends remained almost flat. Both are consistently large uses of cash, but they do not move in tandem."
