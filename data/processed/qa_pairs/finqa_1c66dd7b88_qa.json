        "Yes, there is an inverse relationship suggested by the data. From 2006 to 2007, 'notes payable' decreased significantly by $27.7 million, indicating debt repayment. Concurrently, 'cash and cash equivalents' increased by $29.6 million. While not a direct one-to-one link, a large debt reduction often involves cash outflows, so the strong cash position in 2007 could be related to financing activities that also allowed for this debt paydown, suggesting a potential correlation between cash management and debt reduction strategy."
