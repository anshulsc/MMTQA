        "No, there is no consistent relationship. For the 'BC1_64' setting, 'Correlation-Based Selection' uses 3 variables for an error of 14.11, 'LASSO regression' also uses 3 variables but has a higher error of 14.55. 'Forward Feature Selection NP' uses a much larger number of variables (28) and achieves a significantly better (lower) error of 9.16. This suggests that while a higher number of variables can be better, the specific selection method is critical and simply adding variables is not a guarantee of improvement."
