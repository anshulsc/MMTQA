        "The simultaneous and large increase in both total debt (from $3,532M to $7,215M) and equity (from $14,607M to $19,223M) suggests that the company was pursuing an aggressive growth or expansion strategy. It was actively raising significant capital from both debt and equity markets. This is often done to fund major investments, projects, or acquisitions. The significant jump in the cash-adjusted debt-to-capital ratio from 6% to 22% further indicates a strategic shift towards higher leverage to fuel this growth."
