While there are some spikes like episode 8 (14.12M), the general trend is a decline from the start, a trough in the middle, and then a moderate recovery towards the end of the season, though it never reaches the initial peaks. This suggests viewership is influenced by factors other than just the seasonal progression, such as specific plotlines, time slots, or competing programs."
