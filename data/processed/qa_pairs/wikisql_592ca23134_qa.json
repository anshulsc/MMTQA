Wait, let me re-calculate. Kerry's new total would be 59,740 + 903 = 60,643. Bush's total is 60,782. Bush still wins. My previous conclusion was incorrect. The winner would NOT have changed."

Conversely, the tightest race was in Winnebago (a 0.9 point margin), which had a below-average 'Others' percentage of 0.7%. This suggests that the performance of third-party candidates is not a reliable predictor of the margin between the two main candidates in this dataset."
