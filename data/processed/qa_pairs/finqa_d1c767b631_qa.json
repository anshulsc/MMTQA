This trend completely reversed in 2018, which saw a massive cash inflow of $1853.2 from financing activities, indicating that the company likely raised substantial capital through debt or equity issuance."

This implies a major strategic initiative, such as a large acquisition or significant capital expenditure, which was primarily paid for by raising new capital rather than from operating cash flow."
