        "The 'investing & lending' category grew from $79,497 million in 2014 to $94,245 million in 2015. This growth was overwhelmingly driven by a substantial increase in 'loans receivable2', which surged by $16,469 million (a 56.9% increase). While the 'other' sub-category also grew, its contribution was minor ($875 million). In contrast, 'public equity', 'private equity', and 'debt1' all experienced a decline in value over the same period. Therefore, 'loans receivable2' was the key driver of the positive trend."

This could imply that a significant portion of the company's inventory is financed through these secured agreements, so as inventory levels were reduced, the need for associated financing also fell."
