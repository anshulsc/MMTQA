For example, \u03b2\u2082 has the largest coefficient (0.8237) but its t-statistic (8.418) is much smaller than that of \u03b2\u2084 (126.061), which has a very small coefficient (0.0041). The t-statistic is a ratio of the coefficient to its standard error, so a very small standard error can result in a very large t-statistic even for a small coefficient, as seen with models \u03b2\u2083 through \u03b2\u2086."
