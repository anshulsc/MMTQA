In contrast, 'custody indemnifications and other' is heavily weighted towards investment grade ($18.5B), with a much smaller non-investment grade portion ($3.1B) and no 'not rated' amount. This implies that 'custody indemnifications' are associated with significantly lower credit risk counterparties compared to 'performance guarantees'."

'Financial standby letters of credit' has a high investment grade amount ($49.2B) paired with a high non-investment grade amount ($28.6B). 'Performance guarantees' has similar values for both ($5.7B and $5.0B). However, 'custody indemnifications' has a high investment grade amount ($18.5B) but a very low non-investment grade amount ($3.1B), which contradicts any simple positive correlation suggested by the other two points.
