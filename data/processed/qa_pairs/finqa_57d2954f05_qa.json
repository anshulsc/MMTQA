        "Yes, there appears to be a correlation. The 'office plant & warehouse' type shows a diverse ownership profile, including 5 'ownedleased', 3 'owned', and 3 'leased' properties. In contrast, the 'office & warehouse' type, represented by only two locations, includes one 'ownedleased' and one 'leased' property, but notably lacks any fully 'owned' facilities in this dataset. This suggests that facilities which include a 'plant' are more likely to be at least partially or fully owned by the company compared to those that are only an office and warehouse."

    "answer": [
      [
        "The 'squarefootage' column (D) presents the most structural complexity. While the 'principal use' column contains delimited lists, the 'squarefootage' column contains both standard integer values and concatenated string values (e.g., '1512000150000'). To correctly interpret and use this data for numerical analysis, one must implement a conditional logic that checks the corresponding value in the 'ownership' column (E). If ownership is 'ownedleased', the string must be split into two separate numerical values; otherwise, it can be treated as a single integer. This dependency on another column makes its parsing logic more complex than any other column."
