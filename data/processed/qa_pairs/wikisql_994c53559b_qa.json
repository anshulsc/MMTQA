      [
        "There is a weak correlation between securing pole position and winning the GT3 race. Out of the 14 rounds, the team that started on pole position went on to win the GT3 race in only 3 instances: 'No. 1 Barwell Motorsport' in Round 5, 'No. 6 Team RPM' in Round 6, and 'No. 23 Christians in Motorsport' in Round 12. This represents a win rate of approximately 21.4% from pole, suggesting that pole position provided little to no significant advantage in securing a GT3 class victory in this championship season."
