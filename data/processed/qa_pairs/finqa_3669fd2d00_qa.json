Starting at $18 million in 2012, they decreased to $8 million in 2013, then experienced a massive spike to $214 million in 2014. Following this peak, expirations dropped significantly to $12 million in 2015 and $13 million in 2016, before rising to $60 million for the period after 2016. The pattern is not linear or consistent, but is dominated by the 2014 peak."

        "There is no simple linear correlation, but there is an observable pattern. The largest commitment ('credit facilities', $1800M) has a single, distant expiration date (2015). In contrast, the commitment with the most spread-out expiration schedule ('guarantees', $325M) is one of the smaller ones. The other two commitments ('receivables' and 'standby letters') are paid off entirely in the first year (2012), despite having very different total values ($600M and $24M). This suggests that larger commitments might be structured as single lump-sum payments, while smaller ones are either dealt with immediately or are structured as long-term, distributed obligations."
