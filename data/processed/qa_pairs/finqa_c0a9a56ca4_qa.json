The largest loan categories in the U.S. ('credit card lines' at $867,261M and 'commercial and other consumer loan commitments' at $217,818M) are also the largest outside the U.S. ($135,176M and $92,179M respectively). Conversely, smaller U.S. categories tend to be smaller abroad as well. However, the relationship isn't uniform; 'commercial and similar letters of credit' is an exception, being nearly three times larger outside the U.S. than within it, suggesting that different products have varying levels of international market penetration."
