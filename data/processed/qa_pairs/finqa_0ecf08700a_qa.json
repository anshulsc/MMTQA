    "answer": [

        "There is no consistent, simple correlation observable in the data. For instance, the note with the highest interest rate (8.205%) has a high outstanding value of 521, but the note with the second-highest rate (6.25%) has a much lower value of 298. Conversely, some of the notes with the highest outstanding values, such as the 5.00% note (value 599), have mid-range interest rates. This suggests that other factors, such as the initial issue size, likely have a greater influence on the outstanding value than the interest rate alone."
