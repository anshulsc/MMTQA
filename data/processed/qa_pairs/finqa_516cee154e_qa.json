        "There appears to be an inverse correlation between these two metrics. As the weighted average number of common shares outstanding increased steadily from 2000 to 2002, the basic net income fluctuated, peaking in 2001 before dropping to its lowest point in 2002, the year with the highest number of shares. This suggests that as shares increased, income did not necessarily follow, and in fact, the highest share count corresponds to the lowest income."
