        "Yes, there appears to be a positive correlation. Generally, models with a lower (better) overall MSE also have a lower MSE7. For example, 'ECC Analyzer' and 'HTML' have the two lowest overall MSE scores (0.314 and 0.401) and also two of the lowest MSE7 scores (0.306 and 0.349). Conversely, models like 'MT-LSTM-ATT' and 'LSTM' have the highest overall MSE scores (0.739 and 0.746) among this group and also have relatively high MSE7 scores (0.435 and 0.459). This suggests that a model's general predictive power is consistent across these two specific metrics."
