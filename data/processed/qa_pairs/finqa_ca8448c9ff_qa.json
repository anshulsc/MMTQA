The standard 'home equity and residential real estate loans' portfolio grew by $1,651 million, while both the 'purchased impaired loans' and 'government insured' categories decreased significantly (by $1,090 million and $575 million, respectively). This suggests a strategic shift towards growing the core portfolio while reducing exposure to impaired and government-backed assets."
