Conversely, some of the tournaments with the largest purses had less competitive winning scores, such as the U.S. Senior Open ($2,600,000 purse, -7 score) and the Liberty Mutual Legends of Golf ($3,000,000 purse, -10 score). This suggests that factors other than prize money, such as course difficulty or weather conditions, likely have a greater impact on winning scores."
