        "Ferrari demonstrated strong but inconsistent performance in the latter half of the season. They secured a win with Nigel Mansell at the Hungarian Grand Prix (Rd. 10), and another with Gerhard Berger at the Portuguese Grand Prix (Rd. 13). They also secured two fastest laps with Mansell and a pole position with Berger's teammate Riccardo Patrese in Hungary. Despite these highlights, they did not win any of the other four races in this period, which were all won by McLaren-Honda or Benetton-Ford, indicating that while competitive, they were not the dominant force."

    "answer": [
      [
        "There appears to be a weak correlation between achieving the fastest lap and winning the race. Out of the 15 races, the winning driver also set the fastest lap in only 4 instances (Ayrton Senna at the San Marino, German, and Spanish Grands Prix, and Alain Prost at the French Grand Prix). This means in 11 out of 15 races (approximately 73% of the time), the winner was not the driver who set the single fastest lap, suggesting that overall race pace and strategy are more critical for victory than a single moment of maximum speed."
