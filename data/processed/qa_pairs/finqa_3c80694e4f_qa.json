Total current assets increased by $138.3 million (from $1530.7M to $1669.0M), while the absolute value of total current liabilities increased by only $5.4 million (from $583.8M to $589.2M). Consequently, working capital grew by $132.9 million, a value very close to the asset growth. This indicates that the increase in assets was not primarily funded by a corresponding increase in short-term debt, leading directly to a stronger working capital position."
