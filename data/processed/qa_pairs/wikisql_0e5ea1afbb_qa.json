        "Yes, there appears to be a potential correlation. The three incumbents who faced opponents were Sam Hobbs (first elected 1934), Carter Manasco (1941), and John Sparkman (1936). Of these, Carter Manasco had the shortest tenure and also the narrowest victory margin (45.4%). The other two, with longer tenures, won by much larger margins (76.2% and 84.8% respectively). Furthermore, five incumbents, including some with very long tenures like Frank W. Boykin (1935) and Pete Jarman (1936), ran completely unopposed. This suggests that longer-serving incumbents in this election tended to face less competitive races."
