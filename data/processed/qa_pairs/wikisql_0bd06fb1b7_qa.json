The four players with a perfect doubles record (0 losses) all had short careers of only 1 or 2 years (Lee Tong-Won, Kim Sun-Yong, Cho Soong-Jae, Lee Woo-Ryong). Conversely, players with long careers of 6 years or more all have multiple doubles losses. This suggests that maintaining a perfect doubles record is highly improbable over a long career."
