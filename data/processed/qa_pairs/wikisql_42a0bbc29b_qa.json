Once the 'Proper' rounds begin, there are significant injections of new, higher-ranked clubs in the First and Third rounds (48 and 44 new entries, respectively), while the other 'Proper' rounds feature no new entries at all. This indicates a tiered entry system where teams enter at different stages based on their ranking."

For instance, the prize for the Extra Preliminary Round is £750, which grows to £12,500 by the Fourth Round Qualifying, and reaches £1,000,000 for the winners of the Semi-Finals. This structure heavily incentivizes advancement to the final stages of the competition."
