    "answer": [

        "No, there is not a consistent positive correlation. For example, from 2009 to 2010, sales increased from $6292M to $6723M, and net earnings also increased from $119M to $131M. However, from 2008 to 2009, sales increased from $6189M to $6292M, but net earnings improved from a massive loss of -$2397M to a profit of $119M, a change disproportionate to the revenue increase, likely driven by other factors like the reduction in goodwill impairment. Therefore, while often related, other major expenses heavily influence the final net earnings."
