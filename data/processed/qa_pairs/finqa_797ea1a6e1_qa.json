        "Yes, a pattern is observable. The company's owned facilities tend to be significantly larger than its leased ones. The average size of an owned facility is approximately 515,000 sq ft, with five of them exceeding 650,000 sq ft. In contrast, the two leased facilities are smaller, at 309,000 and 64,000 sq ft. This suggests a corporate strategy of owning major, large-scale distribution hubs while leasing smaller, possibly more flexible or temporary, spaces."
