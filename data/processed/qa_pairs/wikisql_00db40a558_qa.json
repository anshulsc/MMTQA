Out of 14 races, the driver on pole position went on to win the race only 6 times (in rounds 1, 2, 4, 7, 8, and 14). This represents a conversion rate of approximately 42.9%, meaning the pole-sitter failed to win more often than they succeeded, which does not suggest a strong positive correlation."
