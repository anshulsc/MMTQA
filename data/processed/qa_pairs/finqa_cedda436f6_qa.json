        "There is no consistent correlation. From 2011 to 2012, the metrics show a positive correlation, as a slight decrease in sales (from $1732M to $1688M) corresponds with a decrease in income (from $376M to $345M). However, this relationship inverts dramatically in 2013, where a massive drop in net sales to $108M is accompanied by a surge in income to $2014M. This suggests that in 2013, income was driven by factors other than core sales, such as the 'net gain from separation and merger of commodity chemicals business'."
