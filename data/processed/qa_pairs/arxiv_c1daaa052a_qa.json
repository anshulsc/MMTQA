In contrast, the other two works, which do not mention adversarial learning, were tested on either US markets only (CI-STHPAN) or a mix that includes the Chinese CSI market (RT-GCN). This suggests a potential association between using advanced adversarial techniques and validating them on a broader, more globally diverse set of financial markets."
