While 'class b-2 preferred units' has a relatively high number of units (5,576) and the highest par value ($55.8M), the unit type with the most units, 'preferred a units' (2,200,000), has a low par value ($2.2M). Conversely, 'class c downreit units' has the second-highest number of units (61,804) but the lowest par value ($1.9M).
