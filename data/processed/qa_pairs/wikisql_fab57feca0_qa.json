        "The data does not suggest a clear correlation between a horse's weight and its final placing. For instance, the winning horse, Efficient (NZ), carried a relatively heavy weight of 54.5 kg, while horses with even more weight, like Tawqeet (USA) at 57 kg, finished much lower (14th). Conversely, a lightly weighted horse, Dolphin Jo (51.5 kg), secured a top 5 finish, but other horses with similar low weights finished near the back (e.g., Eskimo Queen at 51 kg finished 15th). Placings are distributed across the weight spectrum, indicating weight is likely one of many factors and not a dominant predictor of success in this race."
