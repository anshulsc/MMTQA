While the statutory rate declined steadily from 20.0% to 19.0%, the effective tax rate was highly volatile, moving from 10.6% in 2016, to a peak of 36.5% in 2017, and then down to 11.7% in 2018. This volatility indicates that the effective rate is driven by large, inconsistent adjustment items, such as the 51.2 impact from 'u.s. tax reform' in 2017, rather than the statutory rate."
