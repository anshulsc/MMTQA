This growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in 'loans held-for-sale' (up 156%) and a rise in 'lending-related commitments' (up 2.6%). However, this growth was partially offset by a notable 12.3% decrease in 'derivative receivables' and a 21.3% drop in 'loans at fair value', indicating a shift in the composition of the credit portfolio."

        "There appears to be an inverse relationship within this limited dataset. From year-end 2012 to 2013, 'derivative receivables' decreased from $74,983 million to $65,759 million. Concurrently, 'total wholesale credit-related assets' increased from $411,814 million to $414,067 million. This suggests that as the value of derivative receivables fell, other assets grew to more than compensate, leading to an overall increase in total assets. However, a definitive correlation cannot be established from only two data points."
