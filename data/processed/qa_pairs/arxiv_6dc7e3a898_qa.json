    "answer": [

        "There is a discernible trend in the evolution of methodologies for 'Bankruptcy Risk' studies over time. The earliest study period (1981-1995) utilized SEM. Following that, a study covering the late 1990s (1995-1998) used ML. More recent and longer-spanning studies, particularly those post-2000 (e.g., 2002-2016, 1994-2014), predominantly feature DL, while ML also continues to be used in recent periods (2011-2014, 2016-2018). This suggests a technological progression from traditional econometric models (SEM) to machine learning (ML) and subsequently to more advanced deep learning (DL) approaches."

    "answer": [
      [
        "Yes, there appears to be a correlation between the method category and the experiment size. Deep Learning (DL) and Hybrid Models are frequently associated with very large datasets, including sample sizes in the hundreds of thousands or millions (e.g., 0.11M, 2.4M). In contrast, studies using Statistical and Econometric Models (SEM) tend to have sample sizes in the thousands or high hundreds. Machine Learning (ML) models are applied to the widest range of sample sizes, from as small as 48 to as large as 3.5 million. This suggests that more complex, data-intensive methods like DL are often employed when dealing with massive datasets, while SEM is used for more moderately sized experiments."
