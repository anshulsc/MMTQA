While 2008 had the lowest operating expenses ($510M) and the highest net income ($1820M), suggesting an inverse relationship, this pattern is broken by the other years. In 2009, operating expenses ($1420M) were lower than in 2007 ($1813M), yet 2009 saw a drastically worse net loss (-$8051M) compared to 2007 (-$1968M). This indicates that other factors, such as the severe drop in revenues, had a much larger impact on net income than operating expenses alone."

In 2007, 'net income (loss)' (-$1968M) is correctly derived by subtracting 'net income attributable to noncontrolling interests' ($2M) from 'net income (loss) before attribution...' (-$1966M). However, in both 2008 and 2009, the 'net income (loss)' value is identical to the 'net income (loss) before attribution...' value, incorrectly ignoring the amount attributable to noncontrolling interests. This points to a reporting inconsistency in the table's structure for 2008 and 2009."
