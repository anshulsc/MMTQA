        "There is no clear or consistent correlation between a project's Gross MW and AES's equity interest. For instance, the project with the highest Gross MW ('ballylumford', 1246 MW) has 100% interest, but the second highest ('jhrh', 379 MW) has a low 35% interest. Conversely, a very low MW project ('north rhins', 22 MW) also has 100% interest. The wide distribution of equity stakes across different project sizes suggests that project scale does not directly determine the level of AES investment."
