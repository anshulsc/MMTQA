        "The negative value of '-3693' for '1515 broadway' in the 'fair value adjustment to mortgage note payable' category is a distinct outlier compared to the uniform positive value of '2014' for the other properties. This suggests that the mortgage note associated with the 1515 Broadway acquisition had terms that were more favorable than the prevailing market rates at the time of acquisition, creating an asset (a negative liability adjustment). In contrast, the other properties might have had mortgages at or near market rates, requiring a standard, nominal adjustment."

        "No, there is not a direct positive correlation. For instance, '180 maiden lane' has the second-highest purchase price ($442,325) but its net consideration ($81,835) is nearly identical to that of '51 east 42nd street', which has a much lower purchase price ($80,000). Furthermore, '1515 broadway' has the highest purchase price by a large margin ($1,234,000) but not the highest net consideration. This indicates that other factors, such as 'debt assumed' (which is very high for '1515 broadway'), significantly influence the net consideration required at closing."

        "The value '2014' appears in 'other assets net of other liabilities', 'fair value adjustment to mortgage note payable', 'equity and/or debt investment held', and 'debt assumed'. Its repeated use as a relatively small, identical value across different categories and properties suggests it is not a measured market value but rather a nominal placeholder, a standard minimum value used for accounting purposes, or possibly a reference to a specific event or regulation year (e.g., a transaction from 2014). It signifies a standardized entry rather than a unique valuation for each instance."
