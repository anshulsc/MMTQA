    "answer": [
      [
        "The frequent use of the S&P 500, appearing in half of the studies, implies it serves as a standard benchmark dataset for financial research involving LLMs. Its characteristics—being a well-known, public, extensive, and liquid dataset—make it ideal for testing and comparing the performance of different models and methods for tasks like stock prediction and portfolio selection. This reliance suggests a need for researchers to demonstrate their model's effectiveness on a widely accepted standard before applying it to more niche or proprietary data."

    "answer": [

        "The data suggests an inverse relationship. More complex and specific applications like 'Stock price movement prediction' or 'Financial analysis' tend to leverage a diverse set of models, including multiple generations and families (e.g., 'GPT-3, GPT-4, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3'). In contrast, applications with a seemingly singular focus, like 'Investment portfolio selection' or 'Stock market trend', are shown using a single model like ChatGPT. This implies that tackling nuanced financial tasks may benefit from an ensemble or comparative approach using several advanced LLMs."
