        "After December 28, 2014, the company initiated treasury share activities, as indicated by the negative values appearing in the 'treasury shares' column starting in the period leading up to the January 3, 2016 balance. The balance of treasury shares became increasingly negative, moving from -413 to -2471 by December 31, 2016. This suggests the company was actively buying back its stock or re-issuing treasury shares for employee compensation plans, reducing the total shares held in treasury."
