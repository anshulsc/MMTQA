        "The firm significantly strengthened its capital position from 2012 to 2013. The pro forma Basel III Advanced Approaches Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio increased from 7.5% to 9.5%. This improvement was driven by two factors: a substantial increase in the estimated Tier 1 common capital (from $22,501M to $27,456M) and a simultaneous decrease in the estimated risk-weighted assets (from $301,006M to $290,080M). The introduction of the Standardized Approach ratio at a strong 9.4% in 2013 further underscores this improved capital adequacy."
