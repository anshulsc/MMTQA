    "answer": [
      [
        "Yes, there is a strong positive correlation. As the number of customers increases for a state, the estimated population served also tends to increase. For instance, Pennsylvania has the highest number of customers (666,415) and the largest estimated population served (2.2 million), while West Virginia and California, which have the lowest customer counts, also have the smallest estimated populations served. This implies that the customer base is a direct and proportional component of the population being served by the business in these regions."

The estimated population served per customer for each state is: Pennsylvania (~3.30), Missouri (~3.23), Illinois (~4.17), California (~3.44), Indiana (~4.09), and West Virginia (~3.52). While most states serve between 3.2 and 3.5 people per customer, Illinois and Indiana are notably higher. Illinois has the highest ratio at approximately 4.17, indicating that each customer in Illinois represents a larger portion of the served population compared to other states, making it the most significant outlier."
