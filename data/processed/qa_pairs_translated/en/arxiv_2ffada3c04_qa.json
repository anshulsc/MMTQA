        "There appears to be a correlation between execution type and compute requirements. All four models with 'High' compute (StockFormer, EarnHFT, MacroHFT, HRT) and the one with 'Very High' compute (TRR) are split between 'Direct' (3) and 'Indirect' (2) execution. However, models with 'Medium' or 'Low' compute requirements are predominantly 'Direct' (3 out of 4), with only one using 'Indirect' execution. This suggests that while high-compute models can be either direct or indirect, lower-compute models in this dataset are more likely to employ a direct execution strategy, possibly to minimize latency overhead that an indirect layer might introduce."
