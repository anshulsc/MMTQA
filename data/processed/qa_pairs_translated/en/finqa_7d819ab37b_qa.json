This trend correlates with the steady decrease in 'total staff at period-end' over the same period, suggesting that a reduction in workforce may have led to lower related non-compensation costs, such as 'occupancy' expenses, which also decreased significantly."

        "Yes, there is a strong positive correlation. As the 'total staff at period-end' decreased steadily from 35,700 in 2010 to 32,400 in 2012, the 'occupancy' expenses also saw a consistent and significant decline from $1,086 million to $875 million over the same period. This suggests that a smaller workforce required less office space or led to the consolidation of facilities, thereby reducing occupancy costs."
