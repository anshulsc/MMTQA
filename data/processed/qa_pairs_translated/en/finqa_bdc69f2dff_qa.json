        "There is no consistent, direct correlation suggesting that redeemed shares were systematically converted to Class C (Series I). For instance, Class C (Series II) had over 79 million shares redeemed but no corresponding conversion activity noted. Conversely, Class C (Series IV) had shares converted away from it without significant redemptions. Class C (Series III) is the only one showing both significant redemptions and conversions away from it, but the numbers do not match. This suggests that redemptions and conversions were largely separate transactions rather than a single, combined event for most series."
