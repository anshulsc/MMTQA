The two categories with the largest U.S. exposure, 'credit card lines' and 'commercial and other consumer loan commitments', also experienced the largest absolute decreases in total value from 2008 to 2009. This suggests that the largest domestic credit categories were the primary focus for risk reduction by the institution during this period."
