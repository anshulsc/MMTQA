        "Yes, there is a clear pattern. For hyperparameters with a small search space of two options (Learning Rate, Dropout), the best choice was the maximum value. For all hyperparameters with a larger search space of three or four options, the optimal value was found in the middle of the range, never at the extremes. This suggests that for this model, a fine-tuning process is beneficial, and initial wide ranges successfully bracketed an optimal region that was not at the boundaries of the tested space."

      [
        "The common characteristic is that for all three hyperparameters, the 'Best Choice' is an intermediate value, not an extreme (minimum or maximum). The 'Best Choices' are 256 (3rd of 4), 8 (3rd of 4), and 64 (2nd of 4). This implies a successful tuning strategy where the search space was sufficiently wide to bracket the optimal value, suggesting that performance for these parameters does not monotonically increase with the value but rather peaks somewhere within the tested range."
