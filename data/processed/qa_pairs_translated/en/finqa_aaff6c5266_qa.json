This drop was primarily driven by substantial reductions in two categories: 'Credit card lines,' which decreased by $86,822 million, and 'Commercial and other consumer loan commitments,' which fell by $46,938 million. Together, these two categories account for more than the entire net decrease in total commitments."

While the two categories with the largest U.S. commitments ('Credit card lines' and 'Commercial and other consumer loan commitments') also have the largest commitments outside the U.S., this pattern does not hold for all categories. For instance, 'commercial and similar letters of credit' has one of the smallest U.S. commitments ($1,544M) but the third-largest commitment outside the U.S. ($7,430M), indicating that the geographic distribution of commitments is highly dependent on the specific loan type rather than following a general trend."
