        "The data shows a clear shift in engine usage over time. The Offenhauser engine, which won in 1973 and 1976, does not appear in the winner's circle in later seasons. The Cosworth engine first appears as a winner in 1977 and is used in winning cars consistently through 1979. The Foyt engine also appears starting in 1976 and remains a winning engine type throughout the period. This indicates a decline for Offenhauser and a rise in prominence for Cosworth among winning teams."

While he also won with a Parnelli chassis, the data points towards drivers having a high affinity or preference for a particular chassis for their victories."
