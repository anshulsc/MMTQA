        "Yes, there is a strong positive correlation. As the magnitude of 'ncls' (net credit losses) increases each year, from $9,926 million in 2007 to $30,741 million in 2009, the 'total provision for credit losses' also trends upwards, from $16,832 million to $38,760 million. This suggests that as the bank experiences higher net losses, it correspondingly increases its provision to cover those and anticipated future losses."
