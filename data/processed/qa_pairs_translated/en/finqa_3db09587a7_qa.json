The smallest properties tend to be specialized facilities like the 'data center' (46,903 sq ft). The vast majority of properties, which fall in the mid-to-large size range (56,100 to 171,318 sq ft), are all used as 'property and casualty insurance offices'. This suggests a tiered usage strategy based on facility size, with executive functions requiring the most space, general offices occupying a wide middle range, and specialized infrastructure using the least."
