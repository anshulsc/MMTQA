        "The data strongly suggests a correlation where each day of the week is named after a specific celestial body as indicated in the column headers (e.g., Sunday for the Sun, Monday for the Moon, Tuesday for Mars, etc.). This pattern is evident in many Indic languages like Sanskrit ('Bhaan Vāsaram' for Sun's day) and Hindi ('Somavār' for Moon's day), where the root of the word often corresponds to the Sanskrit name for the celestial body. However, not all languages follow this correlation strictly. For example, Urdu uses 'Pīr' and 'Jum'ah', which have Perso-Arabic origins, and languages like Khmer and Lao have names that do not show an obvious phonetic link to the planets for every day."
