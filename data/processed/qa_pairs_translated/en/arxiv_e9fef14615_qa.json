For the 'ccfraud' and 'taiwan' datasets, Gemini's scores (0.90 and 0.95) are substantially higher than GPT 4's score (0.55 for both). For 'LendingClub', Gemini (0.65) is still moderately higher than GPT 4 (0.55). Only on the 'MLESG' dataset are their scores nearly identical (0.35 vs 0.34). This suggests that while their performance isn't tightly correlated, Gemini is generally a superior model for these specific F1-measured tasks."

The score of 0.95 is the highest value and furthest from this average compared to all other scores. This unusually high performance suggests that the Gemini model is exceptionally well-suited for the task defined by the 'taiwan' dataset and 'F1' metric, or that the task itself was substantially easier for this model than the others."
