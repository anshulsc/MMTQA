Another important limitation is that there was no control group to safely attribute changes, though the results and the longitudinal design are strengths. In addition, it is not possible to know whether the changes are due to physical exercise, the Mediterranean diet reducing caloric intake, or both.",

      " In general, patients carrying out a weight loss program at the Department of Endocrinology are advised to follow a diet (reducing caloric intake) as well as engaging in physical exercise. Further longitudinal studies including only physical exercise [16] would be desirable to determine which is responsible for the connectivity changes\u2014the Mediterranean diet, the physical activity, or both. Moreover, only female subjects were included. We decided to include only female subjects to avoid a sex bias. As a consequence, our results can only be generalized to women. Finally, other technical limitations (e.g., using a six-channel head coil rather than the more standard 12-channel head coil which would have reduced the noise ratio) could influence the findings.",

      " Furthermore, all the functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)s (pre- and post-intervention) were carried out under fasting conditions, and it would be interesting to evaluate brain connectivity in a state of satiety; it is probable that the brain networks found would differ since previous evidence shows that the pathophysiology is different [52,53]. Despite the aforementioned limitations, we still consider our results to be clinically pertinent, as they support the benefits of the Mediterranean diet and may provide a better understanding of the pathophysiology of obesity. However, more longitudinal studies on larger samples, with an appropriate design including a control group, are needed to shed light on the effects of obesity on the brain and to aid in developing future treatments that could act on the neural networks involved in this disease.",

      "  In conclusion, our findings suggest that functional connectivity between specific brain structures involved in obesity physiopathology (the inferior parietal lobe, posterior cingulate, temporo-insular cortex, and prefrontal cortex) might be modified by a weight loss program including a Mediterranean diet and physical exercise.
