      "Flying with a food allergy can be daunting. I receive so many messages from my followers asking about flying and which airlines to choose when you have allergies. I\u2019ve decided to write this blog post to give you a better understanding of my process and hopefully help you manage it better!\n\nPreparing for Your Flight\n\nIt\u2019s important to research the airline\u2019s allergy policies beforehand. Every airline has its own policies regarding allergies, so it's always best to know ahead of time. It can be super frustrating and scary when the airline industry doesn't take your allergy seriously. It's definitely worth taking some time to pick an airline with a good track record, although this can be hard because everyone can have different experiences with the same airline.\n\nSome airlines have changed their policies and no longer serve nuts on flights. This is a massive step forward and a relief for so many people who fly regularly. We can only hope that more airlines follow in their footsteps! It\u2019s also always worthwhile getting a letter from your doctor saying that you have an allergy and carry medication for it.",

      "When it comes to managing food allergies, most of us focus on knowledge. We research symptoms, memorize allergen lists, and practice using an epinephrine injector in controlled scenarios. But what happens when knowledge collides with fear in a moment that demands action? That\u2019s the question I faced during a recent experience with my oldest daughter, and the answer was humbling.\n\nAlarming Signs of a Reaction\n\nOn that afternoon, my daughter \u2013 who has multiple food allergies \u2013 began showing alarming signs of a potential anaphylactic reaction after eating a small bowl of dry Honey Nut Cheerios. She started with excessive, uncontrollable coughing, followed by difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, and a sense of lethargy that sent my heart racing. As I stood there watching her struggle, I was consumed by fear.\n\nMy daughter\u2019s allergies include eggs, dairy, nuts, shellfish, cinnamon, and strawberries. Thankfully, she had recently passed her wheat challenge, and under her allergist\u2019s guidance, we\u2019d reintroduced wheat into her diet. In all her years of managing these allergies, we\u2019ve been fortunate \u2013 she had never experienced a severe reaction requiring an epinephrine pen. But as I watched her symptoms escalate, I knew this might be the moment we had always prepared for.",

      "Mammograms, with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) models, may reveal much more than cancer, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25). The findings highlight how these important cancer screening tools can also be used to assess the amount of calcium buildup in the arteries within breast tissue\u2014an indicator of cardiovascular health.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that middle-aged and older women get a mammogram\u2014an X-ray of the breast\u2014to screen for breast cancer every one or two years. About 40 million mammograms are performed in the United States each year. While breast artery calcifications can be seen on the resulting images, radiologists do not typically quantify or report this information to women or their clinicians. The new study, which used an AI image analysis technique not previously used on mammograms, demonstrates how AI can help fill this gap by automatically analyzing breast arterial calcification and translating the results into a cardiovascular risk score.\n\nWe see an opportunity for women to get screened for cancer and also additionally get a cardiovascular screen from their mammograms. Our study showed that breast arterial calcification is a good predictor for cardiovascular disease, especially in patients younger than age 60. If we are able to screen and identify these patients early, we can refer them to a cardiologist for further risk assessment.\" Theo Dapamede, MD, PhD, postdoctoral fellow at Emory University in Atlanta and study's lead author\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States but remains underdiagnosed in women and there is also lagging awareness. Researchers said the use of AI-enabled mammogram screening tools could help identify more women with early signs of cardiovascular disease by taking better advantage of screening tests that many women routinely receive.\n\n\n\nA buildup of calcium in blood vessels is a sign of cardiovascular damage associated with early-stage heart disease or aging. Previous studies have shown that women with calcium buildup in the arteries face a 51% higher risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\n\n\nTo develop the screening tool used for this study, researchers trained a deep-learning AI model to segment calcified vessels in mammogram images\u2014which appear as bright pixels on X-rays\u2014and calculate the future risk of cardiovascular events based on data obtained from the electronic health record data. The segmentation approach is what separates this model from previous AI models developed for analyzing breast artery calcifications. Researchers said the model is also strengthened by its use of a large dataset for training and testing, which included images and health records from over 56,000 patients who had a mammogram at Emory Healthcare between 2013 and 2020 and had at least five years of follow-up electronic health records data.\n\n\n\n\"Advances in deep learning and AI have made it much more feasible to extract and use more information from images to inform opportunistic screening,\" Dapamede said.\n\n\n\nOverall findings showed the new model performed well at characterizing patients' cardiovascular risk as low, moderate or severe based on mammogram images. After calculating the risk of dying from any cause or suffering an acute heart attack, stroke or heart failure at two years and five years, the model showed that the rate of these serious cardiovascular events increased with breast arterial calcification level in two of the three age categories assessed\u2014women younger than age 60 and age 60-80, but not in those over age 80. This makes the tool particularly well suited for providing early warning of heart disease risk in younger women, who can benefit more from early interventions, researchers said.\n\n\n\nThe results also showed that women with the highest level of breast arterial calcification (above 40 mm2) had a significantly lower five-year rate of event-free survival than those with the lowest level (below 10 mm2). For example, 86.4% of those with the highest breast arterial calcification survived for five years compared with 95.3% of those with the lowest level of calcification. This translates to approximately 2.8 times the risk of death within five years in patients with severe breast arterial calcification compared to those with little to no breast arterial calcification.\n\n\n\nThe AI model was developed as a collaboration between Emory Healthcare and Mayo Clinic and is not currently available for use. If it passes external validation and gains approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, researchers said the tool could be made commercially available for other health care systems to incorporate into routine mammogram processing and follow-up care. The researchers also plan to explore how similar AI models could be used for assessing biomarkers for other conditions, such as peripheral artery disease and kidney disease, that might be extracted from mammograms.",

      "Women of childbearing age who had both ovaries removed, in a procedure called bilateral oophorectomy, were more likely to develop heart failure later in life, according to a study being presented at the American College of Cardiology's Annual Scientific Session (ACC.25).\n\nBilateral oophorectomy is often recommended to treat and, in some cases, prevent certain health issues, including endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, heavy bleeding and ovarian cancer. The new study sheds light on the potential and unique role that this procedure might play in heightening cardiovascular risk given that it abruptly stops the production of estrogen and other hormones and, depending on timing, can induce early onset menopause, which researchers said may be distinct from other causes of early menopause.\n\nWe know that sex hormones, including estrogen and progesterone levels, play a crucial role in cardiovascular risk. Our study shows that there is an association between removing both ovaries and future development of heart failure, in particular. We believe this may be due to early menopause. However, in this case, early menopause results from the planned surgical removal of the ovaries, which differs from other causes such as occult infections, autoimmune diseases or unexpected genetic disorders. Understanding this allows us to anticipate and manage potential complications, particularly cardiovascular disease.\" Narathorn Kulthamrongsri, MD, first-year internal medicine resident, University of Hawaii, Honolulu\n\nThe study uses data from 6,814 female patients who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2017 and 2023. The average age of women undergoing the procedure was 43.6 years and 57 years for heart failure diagnosis. The ages at oophorectomy and heart failure onset were self-reported.\n\nCompared with women in the general population who have their ovaries, those who underwent a bilateral oophorectomy had a 1.5-fold increased risk of developing heart failure after adjusting for race, age, gender, diabetes, smoking status and high cholesterol. White women and those who had their ovaries removed at younger ages had an even higher, twofold increased risk of developing heart failure.\n\n\"The age at which a woman has her ovaries removed appears to [impact] her heart failure risk,\" Kulthamrongsri said. \"We found that as the age at which a woman has her ovaries removed goes up by one year, the development of heart failure happens about 0.6 years later.\"\n\nAccording to researchers, their findings also underscore the need to integrate cardiovascular risk discussions and closer heart monitoring for women contemplating oophorectomy before natural menopause (defined as not having a period for one full year), which usually occurs at 51 years of age, on average.\n\n\"Women must do what is medically necessary in terms of oophorectomy, but our findings suggest they should have an informed discussion with their health care team about how to monitor their cardiovascular health and manage potential risk factors for heart failure, including adopting a healthy lifestyle as much as possible and perhaps asking about any potential role of hormone replacement therapy,\" Kulthamrongsri said.\n\nWhile some women may not have a choice in terms of when they undergo this procedure, for those who do, an informed discussion about the best timing based on their age and health is important to be able to discuss and weigh the potential added cardiovascular risks. This may be especially important for White women who appear to have a much higher risk of developing heart failure.\n\n\"This racial disparity is surprising, as previous research shows that Black individuals have a higher prevalence of worse outcomes in heart failure due to greater risks of hypertension, diabetes and obesity. In contrast, White individuals more often develop heart failure from ischemic heart disease and tend to have more lifestyle-related risk factors, such as smoking, poor diet and physical inactivity. This finding might be explained by the etiology of heart failure that develops in early surgical menopause, related to myocardial infarction or other etiologies in which sex hormones play a crucial role,\" Kulthamrongsri said.\n\nThe study is limited in that it relied on self-reported data and the researchers were only able to look at lifelong risk of heart failure rather than being able to determine if oophorectomy was more likely to lead to heart failure within a certain period after the procedure.\n\nHowever, Kulthamrongsri said the findings add to a growing body of evidence that early surgical menopause may have long-term cardiovascular consequences, particularly an increased risk of heart failure. This concern is especially relevant given the number of women who undergo oophorectomy procedures.\n\nAdditional studies should be done to validate these findings using larger, global datasets. Future research should also explore possible preventive solutions, including cardiovascular screening recommendations and the use of prophylactic heart medications.",

      "Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) find it harder to get pregnant, have more frequent miscarriages and have a higher risk of developing endometrial cancer. Now, in a new study published in Nature Medicine, Swedish researchers have shown that the uterine lining of these women differs in terms of both the composition of individual cells and gene expression. The results open the door to new drug treatments.\n\nPCOS is the most common hormonal disorder affecting 11-13% of women of reproductive age. Women with the syndrome have difficulty getting pregnant and are at increased risk of miscarriage and uterine cancer, especially cancer of the endometrium. It is also common for affected women to be overweight and insulin resistant.\n\nBy studying endometrial tissue samples from five healthy women and 12 women with PCOS, the researchers created a cell map of individual cells. The women were all of similar age, weight and BMI and the tissue samples were taken at the same phase of the menstrual cycle to eliminate factors that could influence the analyses. In the study, all women were overweight, but only the women with PCOS were insulin resistant and had elevated levels of male sex hormones.\n\nIn total, almost 250,000 cell nuclei from the women's uterine linings were analyzed. The researchers found a clear difference in the composition of cell types with a higher proportion of so-called epithelial cells and a lower proportion of stromal cells in the uteruses of women with PCOS.\n\nThese results show that the growth of the cells is affected, which may explain why it can take longer for affected women to become pregnant and why they are more likely to miscarry, as well as contributing to the increased risk of endometrial cancer.\" Elisabet Stener-Victorin, Professor of Reproductive Physiology at Karolinska Institutet and research leader of the current study\n\nIn the detailed cell map, the researchers can show that many genes in specific cell types have a disturbed expression in women with PCOS. A large proportion of the affected genes are linked to difficulties for the early embryo to attach to the uterus, miscarriage and endometrial cancer with functions affecting cell-to-cell attachment and communication.\n\n\"Our analyses show that certain cell types in the endometrium have disrupted communication and interaction specific to PCOS,\" says Gustaw Eriksson, one of the study's first authors and a doctoral student in Elisabet Stener-Victorin's research group.\n\nThe study also included a part where the women with PCOS underwent treatment with the diabetes drug metformin with or without lifestyle advice on diet and exercise. After 16 weeks of treatment, the researchers found that many gene expressions in specific cell types, especially in the epithelial and stromal cells, were normalised by metformin, but also by lifestyle changes, although not as pronounced.\n\n\"We can show that metformin seems to have many more functions in women with PCOS than lowering blood sugar. In the study, all the women were overweight, but it is likely that metformin has similar effects in affected women who are not overweight but insulin resistant if they have problems getting pregnant or have repeated miscarriages,\" says Elisabet Stener-Victorin.\n\nAnother important finding was the correlation between gene expression in specific cell types and important clinical features of PCOS, such as elevated levels of male sex hormone and insulin resistance, highlighting the complex relationship between hormonal and metabolic factors and endometrial dysfunction.\n\n\"As we identified changes in gene expression in specific cell types, this study provides crucial guidance for developing more targeted treatments for PCOS-related endometrial dysfunction,\" says Elisabet Stener-Victorin.\n\nThe study is a collaboration with Dr Congru Li as joint first author, and Associate Professor Qiaolin Deng and Associate Professor Sophie Petropoulos with joint senior and corresponding authorship.\n\nThe research was funded by the Swedish Research Council, the Novo Nordisk Foundation, the Diabetes Foundation and the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, among others.",

      "Healthcare professionals need better support to help recognize and treat symptoms of disordered eating in people living with type 1 Diabetes, according to new research from the University of Surrey.\n\nDisordered eating in people living with type 1 Diabetes is often referred as T1DE. Diabulimia is one example of T1DE, a dangerous eating disorder which involves deliberate misuse of insulin for weight loss, leading to severe health problems and even death. New research from Surrey, led by Dr Katie Fitzgerald and supervised by Dr Rose-Marie Satherley, highlights the challenges healthcare professionals face in recognizing and treating T1DE.\n\nThe study, published in Diabetic Medicine, has found that healthcare professionals face difficulties identifying and addressing T1DE in practice. This is due to a lack of support, limited confidence, and the fears of their patients' reactions and of damaging their patient-healthcare provider relationships. This may lead to delays in diagnosis and potentially life-threatening complications for patients.\n\nThe study found that some healthcare professionals often perceived T1DE as an \"inevitable\" consequence of living with type 1 diabetes, leading to a sense of helplessness. This perspective, combined with a lack of training and clear guidelines, can contribute to missed opportunities for early detection and support.\n\nDr Rose-Marie Satherley, co-author of the study and lecturer in Clinical Psychology at the University of Surrey, said:\n\n\"Our study highlights the need for better training and clear clinical guidelines to support healthcare professionals in addressing disordered eating in adults with type 1 diabetes. The phrase \"a bit of a black hole\" that was used by one participant, aptly captures the uncertainty and confusion surrounding T1DE.\n\n\"There is a real fear and lack of confidence these professionals are experiencing, so we must address the intersection of physical and mental health in diabetes care. We must equip our teams with psychological-expertise, effective communication strategies, as well with the tools and support they need to have these critical conversations to help improve their patients' health.\"",

      "Many breast cancer (BC) survivors experience accelerated aging, potentially due to the cancer itself or the effects of various treatments.\n\nA recent study in Aging explored the relationship between Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PAA) and BC characteristics and treatments.\n\nStudy: Accelerated aging associated with cancer characteristics and treatments among breast cancer survivors. Image Credit: Ground Picture/Shutterstock.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. However, early diagnosis and treatment significantly improve survival rates, with five- and ten-year survival rates at 91% and 85%, respectively.\n\nAs a result, millions of women are living as BC survivors, including four million in the United States alone.\n\nDespite their extended lifespan, BC survivors often face faster cognitive decline and physical frailty compared to women without cancer. The study utilized a relatively new measure of aging\u2014Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PAA)\u2014to evaluate biological aging in BC survivors.\n\nPAA is calculated by combining chronological age (CA) with C-reactive protein (CRP, an inflammatory marker) and eight routine blood biomarkers, providing a cost-effective and accessible way to assess aging and predict mortality risk.\n\nStudy participants\n\nThe study included 1,264 BC patients and 429 cancer-free controls. BC patients were, on average, five years older than controls and had double the mortality rate (8% vs. 4%) over a median follow-up period of nine years.\n\nAt diagnosis, 68% of patients were in stage I or II, while 17% had stage III/IV disease. High-grade tumors were present in 35% of cases, with intermediate-grade tumors in 39%. Nearly half (45%) of patients had hormone receptor-positive but HER2-negative (HR+/HER2-) BC, while 13% had HER2-positive BC and 14% had triple-negative BC (TNBC).\n\nTreatment varied widely. Surgery was the most common intervention, performed in nearly 90% of cases. Chemotherapy was used in 60% of patients, while 51% received radiation therapy and 66% underwent hormone therapy.\n\nTargeted therapy was administered to 17% of patients, but only 3% received immunotherapy. Over the follow-up period, 2% developed a second BC, and 20% experienced metastasis or recurrence.\n\nStudy findings\n\nBC patients exhibited higher PAA than controls. At diagnosis, their phenotypic age (PA) exceeded their chronological age (CA) by an average of four years. This gap narrowed to two years at one-year post-diagnosis and one year at ten years, with no significant differences at two or five years.\n\nThe degree of PAA varied based on several factors. Patients diagnosed at age 65 or older were initially phenotypically younger than their CA, but over time, they aged faster, surpassing their CA by 1.5 years at two, five, and ten years.\n\nThose with stage III/IV BC exhibited a five-year PAA at diagnosis, which persisted for ten years. High-grade tumors were linked to sustained accelerated aging, peaking at a three-year difference at one year and remaining two years higher at year ten.\n\nCancer subtypes also influence aging patterns. HER2+ patients aged faster than HR+/HER2- patients, with a PAA of two years at year one and 1.5 years at year five.\n\nTNBC patients experienced an accelerated aging rate of 3.5 years at year one and two years at year two. However, by year ten, this trend reversed, and their PA was two years lower than their CA.\n\nTreatment impact on aging\n\nDifferent treatment modalities had varying effects on aging. Surgery appeared to have a protective effect, with patients showing a phenotypic age seven years younger than their CA at year ten. Radiation therapy alone resulted in a two-year reduction. When both were used together, the impact was similar to that of surgery alone.\n\nChemotherapy and targeted therapy did not significantly impact PAA when administered alone. However, combination regimens that included chemotherapy led to accelerated aging by four years at one-year post-diagnosis.\n\nPatients who received hormone therapy\u2014whether alone or alongside chemotherapy and targeted therapy\u2014aged nearly three years faster than their CA at both one and ten years.\n\nAmong chemotherapy agents, alkylating agents and anthracyclines initially increased PAA by two years at year one. However, this effect reversed over time, leading to a two- to 2.5-year reduction in PA at years five and ten.\n\nIn contrast, antimetabolites, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) initially reduced PA by a year at year two.\n\nHowever, antimetabolites ultimately accelerated aging by seven years at year ten, while AIs added two years to the CA at the same time point. These findings suggest that hormone therapy may contribute to faster aging overall.\n\nMechanisms of accelerated aging\n\nAccelerated aging in BC survivors may result from multiple factors. Cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce cellular senescence, telomere shortening, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, and epigenetic alterations. The study indicates that these effects may persist even ten years after diagnosis.\n\nHormone therapy may also play a role by disrupting normal hormonal adaptation, genomic stability, and mitochondrial function, leading to stem cell exhaustion and increased biological aging.\n\nConclusions\n\n\u201cThis study provides evidence of accelerated aging among BC survivors and identifies high-risk populations based on tumor characteristics and treatments.\u201d Notably, this is the first study to apply PAA based on biochemical markers rather than epigenetic parameters in BC survivors.\n\nHowever, the findings must be interpreted cautiously due to selection and survival biases. Patients with high-grade tumors or aggressive treatments may have higher PAA but also higher rates of recurrence or death, potentially skewing results.\n\nAdditionally, tumor characteristics primarily influence aging at diagnosis rather than during follow-up.\n\nFurther research is needed to explore how demographic and lifestyle factors interact with aging-related outcomes in BC survivors, particularly with modern treatment regimens. These insights could help improve long-term care and quality of life for survivors.",

      "For the first time scientists have identified promising drug candidates that bind irreversibly with a notoriously \"undruggable\" cancer protein target, permanently blocking it.\n\nTranscription factors are proteins that act as 'master switches' of gene activity and play a key role in cancer development. Attempts over the years to design \"small molecule\" drugs that block them have been largely unsuccessful, so in recent years scientists have explored using peptides \u2013 small protein fragments \u2013 to block these \"undruggable\" targets.\n\nNow researchers from the University of Bath have for the first time detailed an approach to discover peptides that bind selectively and irreversibly within cells, permanently blocking a transcription factor that drives cancer known as cJun.\n\nThe team, publishing in the journal Advanced Science, used a new drug discovery screening platform technology, called the Transcription Block Survival (TBS) assay, which tests a huge number of peptides to \"switch off\" transcription factors that drive cancer.\n\nTheir previous work identified reversible inhibitors of cJun, but this latest work builds on that by discovering peptides that bind selectively and irreversibly within cells, permanently blocking cJun action.\n\nThe transcription factor cJun has two identical halves, which bind on either side of the DNA strand to alter gene expression.\n\nIt can become overactive in cancer, driving uncontrolled cell growth, so the researchers designed a peptide inhibitor that binds to one half of cJun, stopping it from forming pairs and attaching to the DNA.\n\nOnce they had made a peptide that bound to the transcription factor, the researchers modified it to bind irreversibly.\n\nThe inhibitor works a bit like a harpoon that fires across to the target and won't let go \u2013 it grips the cJun tightly and stops it from binding to the DNA. We'd previously identified reversible inhibitors but this is the first time we've managed to block a transcription factor irreversibly with a peptide inhibitor.\" Dr. Andy Brennan, first author of the study and Research Fellow, University of Bath's Department of Life Sciences\n\nFor the Transcription Block Survival assay, researchers inserted binding sites for cJun, into an essential gene in cells grown in the lab. As cJun binds to the gene, it prevents it working and the cell dies. In contrast, if cJun is blocked by the peptide inhibitor, the gene activity is restored and the cell survives.\n\nJody Mason, CSO of Revolver Therapeutics and Professor of Biochemistry in the University of Bath's Department of Life Sciences, said: \"Many drug candidates that are effective in vitro turn out to be toxic or don't penetrate cancer cells at all.\n\n\"However our platform screens for peptide activity directly in the cell, overcoming many common challenges faced by drugs based on small molecules or antibodies.\n\n\"The screen checks the activity of the inhibitor in a real cell environment which includes proteases and other proteins that can sometimes interfere with peptide activity, whilst also checking toxicity.\n\n\"We hope this technology can in the future uncover other promising drug candidates for previously 'undruggable' targets.\"\n\nHaving proven cell permeability and activity in cancer cells, as well as target selectivity, the researchers now need to show the inhibitors work in preclinical cancer models.\n\nThe research was partly funded by the Medical Research Council and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.",

Biohacking, an emerging and revolutionary approach to human enhancement, offers just that.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bImage Credit: Girts Ragelis/Shutterstock.com\n\nIntroduction\n\nBiohacking has surged in popularity as a means to optimize health and extend lifespan, blending scientific advancements with a do-it-yourself ethos. At its core, biohacking encompasses a wide range of strategies, from lifestyle modifications to cutting-edge biotechnology.1\n\nWhile some methods, like optimizing diet, exercise, and sleep, have strong scientific backing, more experimental approaches, such as implantable technologies and genetic self-modification, raise ethical and safety concerns.1\n\nOne scientifically supported biohacking strategy is the use of wearable biosensors to track physiological data, allowing individuals to fine-tune their health in real-time.1\n\nAdditionally, dietary interventions such as intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets have been shown to enhance metabolic health and promote longevity by influencing cellular pathways like autophagy and insulin sensitivity.2\n\nSupplementing with nootropics or compounds that may improve cognitive function is another avenue under investigation, with some substances like caffeine and omega-3 fatty acids demonstrating benefits.3\n\nHowever, more extreme biohacking methods, including self-experimentation with gene editing or unregulated supplements, lack robust scientific validation and pose significant risks. Additionally, the use of implantable technologies, where individuals insert Radio\n\nFrequency Identification and Near Field Communication chips, biosensors, or magnets into their bodies to interact with electronic devices or augment their senses have raised significant ethical concerns.1\n\nAs biohacking continues to evolve, distinguishing evidence-based strategies from speculative or hazardous practices remains essential for its responsible application.1\n\nThis article explores five evidence-based biohacking strategies with the potential to promote longevity.\n\nThe Rise of Postbiotics for Gut Health\n\nIntermittent fasting\n\nIntermittent fasting involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting, promoting metabolic adaptation. Research suggests that intermittent fasting enhances longevity by triggering autophagy, reducing oxidative stress, and improving insulin sensitivity.4\n\nA key mechanism behind these benefits is the metabolic switch from glucose to ketone-based energy, which has been linked to improved mitochondrial function and reduced inflammation.5\n\nStudies indicate that intermittent fasting may lower the risk of metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and neurodegenerative conditions.2 Additionally, intermittent fasting has been shown to modulate gut microbiota, which plays a crucial role in immune function, inflammation, and overall health.5\n\nFurthermore, emerging research suggests that intermittent fasting can also influence gene expression related to longevity by activating sirtuins, a family of proteins involved in cellular repair and aging.4\n\nHowever, the long-term implications of different intermittent fasting protocols remain an area of active research, necessitating further clinical trials to establish optimal fasting durations for longevity benefits.\n\nDespite its benefits, intermittent fasting is not suitable for everyone. Individuals with certain metabolic disorders, pregnant women, or those with a history of eating disorders should consult a medical professional before attempting fasting regimens.2\n\nFuture studies should focus on personalized approaches, considering factors such as genetic predisposition, lifestyle, and existing health conditions.\n\nCold exposure therapy\n\nCold exposure, including practices such as ice baths and cryotherapy, induces hormesis \u2014 a biological phenomenon where mild stressors elicit adaptive benefits. Exposure to cold also activates brown adipose tissue (BAT), leading to enhanced thermogenesis and metabolic efficiency.6\n\nMoreover, research suggests that cold exposure modulates immune function, reducing inflammation and neuroinflammation.7 This effect may be particularly relevant for aging, as chronic low-grade inflammation is a key driver of age-related diseases.\n\nIn addition to reducing inflammation, cold exposure has been linked to increased norepinephrine levels, which contribute to improved mood, cognitive function, and stress resilience.7,8\n\nSome studies suggest that regular exposure to cold temperatures may even enhance cardiovascular health by improving vascular function and circulation.8\n\nHowever, excessive cold exposure can be harmful, leading to hypothermia or increased cardiovascular strain in individuals with pre-existing health conditions.8 It is essential to adopt a gradual approach, starting with brief cold showers or localized ice application before progressing to more extreme methods such as ice baths.\n\nFurther research is essential to determine the ideal duration and frequency of cold exposure to maximize longevity benefits while minimizing potential risks.\n\nDownload your PDF copy now!\n\nNutrigenomics and supplements\n\nNutrigenomics explores the relationship between genes, diet, and health, allowing for personalized nutritional interventions. Certain compounds, such as nicotinamide mononucleotide and resveratrol, have been studied for their potential role in enhancing cellular energy production and lifespan extension.\n\nNicotinamide mononucleotide supplementation has been shown to boost the levels of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), a coenzyme critical for mitochondrial function and cellular repair, which declines with age.9\n\nSimilarly, resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, has been linked to the activation of sirtuins, proteins associated with lifespan extension in various organisms.10\n\nPolyphenols such as quercetin and curcumin have also been studied for their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, which may contribute to healthy aging.\n\nRecent advancements in microbiome research have also highlighted the role of gut bacteria in metabolizing nutrients and influencing health outcomes. Probiotics and prebiotics may enhance gut health, promoting better nutrient absorption and immune function.\n\nAdditionally, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, and magnesium are emerging as key nutrients in longevity science, with studies linking them to reduced risks of chronic diseases.10,3\n\nWhile nutrigenomics shows promise, supplementation should be tailored to individual needs. Overuse of certain compounds can lead to adverse effects, and more research is needed to establish optimal dosages and long-term safety.\n\nIs The Carnivore Diet Healthy?\n\nRegulating circadian rhythms for longevity\n\nQuality sleep is a crucial determinant of longevity, with evidence linking disrupted sleep patterns to increased risks of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and metabolic disorders.11 Melatonin, a hormone that regulates circadian rhythms, plays a key role in sleep quality and longevity.\n\nMaintaining a consistent sleep schedule and minimizing exposure to artificial light at night can improve sleep quality and support healthy aging.\n\nAligning lifestyle habits with natural circadian rhythms, such as enhancing exposure to natural light to increase melatonin production, may also promote optimal hormonal balance and metabolic efficiency.12\n\nIn addition to melatonin, sleep hygiene practices such as reducing caffeine intake, optimizing the bedroom environment, and engaging in relaxation techniques before bed contribute to better sleep quality. Poor sleep has been associated with increased levels of beta-amyloid, a protein linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease.12\n\nMoreover, emerging research suggests that deep sleep plays a crucial role in metabolic regulation, immune function, and brain detoxification.\n\nFuture studies should also explore the interplay between sleep and longevity, identifying potential interventions to enhance sleep efficiency and mitigate age-related decline.\n\nNeuroplasticity and cognitive health\n\nCognitive decline is a major challenge in aging populations. Strategies to enhance neuroplasticity \u2014 such as meditation, brain-training exercises, and nootropic compounds \u2014 have been extensively investigated for their potential to slow cognitive aging and improve mental resilience.3\n\nMeditation has also been shown to reduce stress-related neuroinflammation, while studies have reported that certain nootropics, such as caffeine, may enhance cognitive function.\n\nRegular physical exercise, particularly aerobic and resistance training, has been associated with increased neurogenesis and improved brain health.3\n\nTechnological advancements in neurofeedback and brain-computer interfaces may further enhance cognitive longevity.\n\nCurrent studies are striving to identify the most effective cognitive enhancement strategies while balancing efficacy with ethical considerations and safety.\n\nThe longevity blueprint: Key takeaways\n\nBiohacking presents a promising avenue for longevity optimization, but it requires a critical and evidence-based approach.\n\nWhile intermittent fasting, cold exposure, nutrigenomics, sleep optimization, and neuroplasticity interventions show scientific merit, their long-term implications need further exploration.\n\nThe current understanding suggests that future research should focus on refining these strategies and personalizing interventions to maximize their benefits while minimizing risks.\n\nAdopting a holistic, scientifically validated approach to biohacking may provide a sustainable pathway to extended health span and improved quality of life.\n\nReferences\n\nYetisen A.
