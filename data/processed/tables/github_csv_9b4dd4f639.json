      "**What My Project Does:**  \n**[YTSage](https://github.com/oop7/YTSage)** is a modern YouTube downloader designed for simplicity and functionality. With a sleek PyQt6 interface, it allows users to:  \n- \ud83c\udfa5 Download videos in various qualities with automatic audio merging.  \n- \ud83c\udfb5 Extract audio in multiple formats.  \n- \ud83d\udcdd Fetch both manual and auto-generated subtitles.  \n- \u2139\ufe0f View detailed video metadata (e.g., views, upload date, duration).  \n- \ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Preview video thumbnails before downloading.  \n\n---\n\n**Target Audience:**  \nYTSage is ideal for:  \n- Casual users who want an easy-to-use video and audio downloader.  \n- Developers looking for a robust yt-dlp-based tool with a clean GUI.  \n- Educators and content creators who need subtitles or metadata for their projects.  \n\n---\n\n**Comparison with Existing Alternatives:**  \n- **vs yt-dlp**: While yt-dlp is powerful, it operates through the command line. YTSage simplifies the process with an intuitive graphical interface.  \n- **vs other GUI downloaders**: Many alternatives lack modern design or features like subtitle support and metadata display. YTSage bridges this gap with its PyQt6-powered interface and advanced functionality.  \n\n---\n\n**Getting Started:**  \nDownload the pre-built executable from the [Releases](https://github.com/oop7/YTSage/releases) page \u2013 no installation required! For developers, source code and build instructions are available in the repository.\n\n---\n\n**Screenshots:**  \n[Main Interface](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dc04ecf-082e-458a-acfe-2c5482d36de2)  \n*Main interface with video metadata and thumbnail preview*  \n\n[Subtitle Options](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b001ceb5-5446-4b56-b00c-b578814e2cf0)  \n*Support for both manual and auto-generated subtitles*  \n\n---\n\n**Feedback and Contributions:**  \nI\u2019d love your thoughts on how to make YTSage better! Contributions are welcome on GitHub.  \n\n\ud83d\udd17 [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/oop7/YTSage)",

      "Hi everyone!\n\nI\u2019ve created a script for scraping public social media accounts for work purposes. I\u2019ve wrapped it up, formatted it, and created a repository for anyone who wants to use it.\n\n# What My Project Does\nThe main focus of this project is to scrape data from profiles and their posts. For example:\n- In my job, I\u2019ve automated it to run daily for our social media profiles, storing the data for later analysis.\n- A firend of mine wanted to download all the thumbnails of a youtube channel.\n\n# How it works\nThe script uses Playwright to intercept requests and clean up the data. It also includes a second part that converts images to Base64 encoding, which is useful when image URLs expire or cannot be displayed directly in an `HTML img tag`. For YouTube, it uses the API v3, as it's straightforward to obtain an API key.\n\nI believe the script is easy to use, and you can quickly adapt it to suit your needs. Be sure to check out the README for more details!\n \n# Target Audience\nThis tool is for anyone who needs to scrape social media data. The code is simple enough to copy, modify, and integrate into your project.\n\n# Comparison\nI haven\u2019t extensively researched if there are better solutions out there. However, you can consider using libraries like Instaloader or Twitter-scraper for similar functionality.\n\n# Finally\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts and any feedback you have.\n\n# Links\n- https://github.com/luciomorocarnero/scraping_media",
