      "Let me add the rest of what should have been in the headline: \u201cwithout due process.\"   And there it is. There's the actual endgame.\u00a0   Here in Alabama, one of our state legislators just presented a bill to move inmates imprisoned in Alabama to overseas prisons. He knew it wouldn't pass this session, because it's too late in the session. (Read: He didn't say it wouldn't pass because members would vote it down.) It was clearly a message to the people, as he said it was, as well as a test run to gauge public outrage.\u00a0   Trump has already floated the idea.\u00a0   I'm curious now as to how many other states have seen ideas like this being floated around.\u00a0   The administration has learned that there are no legal consequences to having masked mystery men snatch people off the street, even if they're getting the wrong target, and tossing them into an unmarked van and never allowing them to contact a relative or lawyer. They've learned that\u00a0all they need to do is get someone out of the country quickly enough to suspend their constitutional rights.\u00a0   Why in the fucking fuckity fuck would anyone even come close to thinking that this would stop at illegal immigrants and/or criminals? It shouldn't have even started there, and this right here is why.\u00a0",

      "I disagree. Empty shelves, sure, bad economy, sure, but all but a few of the most extreme authoritarians of the 21st century prefer to stay away from giant destabilizing events like that.   If you want to see into the future, look no further than Orban\u2019s Hungary. Mind you, they invited him to speak at CPAC in 2022 (I think - could be off by a year or two). They\u2019ve been very open about their admiration. Steve Bannon referred to Orban as \u201cTrump before Trump\u201d.  Calling off elections entirely, starting what may very be a civil war is bad for business and bad for holding onto power. What we\u2019ve seen already, and what we should expect to see as long as the current crop of authoritarians is in power, is instead targeted lawfare against any and all critics, highly corrupt government purchasing process that enriches friends and bankrupts opponents or shuts them out completely, so on and so forth.   In Hungary, because Orban *is* the state, the state run news channel featured 3 back to back recorded Orban speeches in a single day leading up to a recent election. The opposing party got a total of 5 minutes of tv time the entire campaign. The independent outlets have all either been bought out by loyalists who were made rich/stayed rich through corruption, or shriveled up into irrelevance after repeated threats and legal attacks. Thinking about the U.S., the president doesn\u2019t need to personally control the Washington post, he just has to convince Jeff Bezos that his companies will be targeted/investigated/etc. if he doesn\u2019t control the reporters who work for him.  It\u2019s a lot more sinister IMO, because unlike the sloppy and violent coups or power grabs that are made abundantly clear to the outside world and citizens when armed military members take over a broadcast on live TV or something, tanks rolling through the streets, when you take the Orban path there\u2019s never a single moment when power is officially seized or when citizens flee en masse. If you\u2019re an ordinary person, you can go on living your life for quite a while without too much major interruption. You keep your job, the company just happens to be bought out by a party loyalist at some point. There\u2019s still food at the store, it\u2019s just harder to afford year over year. The markets take some hits and all the corruption doesn\u2019t help with growth, but there\u2019s never a point at which foreign investment totally ceases or you see sanctions for human rights abuses or something. There\u2019s just always some deniability, and the leaders, as well as the large number of genuine believers, will never admit that the country isn\u2019t free - it\u2019ll just become harder and harder for any opposition party to win anything meaningful or for anyone to get ahead while publicly holding views critical of the state.",

      "\u201cUndocumented immigrants (who, say, overstayed their visa, which is a civil violation rather than a crime; or who were smuggled here when they were toddlers)\u201d  Not contesting the validity of your post, I just wanted to correct and clarify an important detail. An immigrant that is undocumented means that they entered the US without the governments consent, knowledge and without legal immigration status (no visa). A person who overstays their visa is an out-of-status alien, which as you stated is distinctly different. Generally, an out-of-status alien would not be at risk for deportation proceedings and can regain legal status with USCIS by applying for a change of status. If an out-of-status alien leaves and tries to renter the US, they will be issued a no-entry ban for a time period related to the length of time they were out-of-status (greater than 180 days is 10 year ban).   Source: I was an out-of-status alien in the US for about 6-7 years in the US before applying for an recieving PR status. My mother was also out of status during the same period, she left the US for the birth of my brother\u2019s child and was issued a 10 year ban for being out of status when she attempted to return.",

If shelves actually go empty and people are starving enough to riot en masse the administration's support will collapse, even more so than it already has, and there just isn't any way for them to maintain control in that situation.  And even absent that, polling reveals that despite hyperpartisan divides, the underlying principles of American governance are broadly popular. Something like 80% of people believe the administration should obey court orders. 75% do not think Trump should run for a third term. Those numbers are bad enough that even his core base is not behind him, and both are a far cry from suspending elections. Especially with his approval already rapidly declining, I just don't see something like this working at all.  Recall that several of the nations involved in the Arab Spring had successful democratic revolutions, and in some cases the military ended up aligning with the protestors rather than the government.",

Colloquially, when someone says an \"undocumented immigrant\" they're usually, ironically, speaking about an out-of-status alien, as that is what the vast majority of those without legal status actually are. Most people here without currently valid papers got here via a Visa initially, whether for tourism or temporary work.   After all, smuggling yourself in -- or, rather, being smuggled in via a coyote -- requires both a certain sort of desperation and access to funds that is relatively uncommon.

Citizen deportation has happened in anomalous circumstances in the past, and those individuals were granted large civil rewards from the federal government after the mistake was realized.

      "Do you know how big the US is? Our population is TEN times greater than yours, spread out wayyyy more.  ICE is not that big of an agency - 20k total employees right now,  including all the support staff. There aren't enough agents between the FBI, ICE, and the Dept of Homeland Security to even show up to the polling places in ONE state.   Additionally, you have to be a citizen to vote. And with all the hullabaloo about \"immigrants voting\" (which isn't happening), it'll probably be standard practice for people to carry things like birth certificates and passports. At that point you've got federal agencies openly and knowingly harassing citizens to tamper with an election. So then it becomes a question of whether the state national guard, state police, county sheriffs, city police, plus the election security people are going to just let federal agents do that. Our country is primarily run by the states, who are not answerable to the federal government. It's not the same as Canada. You may already know that, but most people don't.  And as I said, IF we reach such a state in the next year, then all of this is moot. Because we have - sometime before then - give over to a full fascist coup and the military is complicit. But the way the tides are running right now, I don't believe that is going to happen.",

As a reminder, when Saddam had \"traitors\" and folks accused of being disloyal dragged out of a meeting and shot, those were not criminals, journalists, or the opposition part.  That entire meeting was just people in his own party.   They always purge their own party _first_.  And they purge it arbitrarily - not based on *actual* loyalty, because the goal is to cement compliance through terror.   The people dragged out and shot were every bit as loyal as the ones who weren't - they were just slower to realize what was happening or reluctant to point the finger at their friends and colleagues to send them to their deaths.    I dunno, man, but if Trump invites himself to speak to Congress and only invites the Republicans, I'm sure they'll think that's great because excluding the Democrats will trigger the libs so much, it'd be tempting to go and gloat.

      "\u201cI understand Trump is doing his job as president, and these are the processes,\" she said, \"but the cases should move more quickly if people aren't associated with a gang, or don't have a criminal record.\"  She\u2019s not entirely wrong; she was denied entry by law. The problem is not that the process should move more quickly but the manner in which a person is deported. Please correct me if I\u2019m wrong.  A lecturer in Law at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School One says there are a few scenarios on how deportation can go:  1. You're put back on the plane and sent back, and there, the carrier has to pay for you.  2. You get sent to secondary screening.   \u201c\u2019I see there's a little bit of blood on your blouse. Have you been coughing blood? Might you have TB?\u2019\u201d he shared as an example. \u201cAnd so you go to this room, and they could check you out for TB.\u201d   3. You will be detained for various reasons, including traveling with false documents or being a perceived security threat.   She doesn\u2019t seem to understand that the president could have saved the US from spending any money at all by just sending her back.

      "I don\u2019t either either point of view is actually all that rational. At this point, assuming you can predict anything an admin like this will do is pretty foolish. We can only really say what they might do. In the end what actually happens will probably be at least somewhat different from what anyone here is expecting. In the situation we are in now, the only thing any of us can know, for sure, is that this administration is more dangerous than any state the government has been in for a long time. And it will likely grow even more dangerous if it is left unchecked.   The real question is: what will it take to finally produce a contrary power to provide that check? Trying to focus too much on one potential answer to that question is where both of these guys went wrong, imo. It could be anything. Protests. Challenges by the establishment through the courts and the legal system. Cooperation against the government by private groups and individuals. These are the things we can expect to happen, and are happening right now. What else might happen beyond that is anyone\u2019s guess.   No one actually knows what that will look like, in truth. It could very well range anywhere from to simply voting against them in coming elections, all the way to a potential civil uprising of some sort, if things get really bad. Of the two extremes, the latter is far less likely, but it is equally as foolish to dismiss it as a possibility as it is to presume it is an absolute certainty. Conversely, it\u2019s also foolish to presume mid-term elections will occur normally given everything that is going on. It almost certainly will be anything but normal, even if they do happen and function more or less as we expect them to.   Was that first guy being a bit hyperbolic? Sure. It is also an exaggeration to say that it\u2019s not a concern at all or that it outright would never happen. So in responding, the other guy was essentially doing the same thing, just by taking up the opposite viewpoint. A more measured take would be to acknowledge the potential for both outcomes to be true rather than simply try to dismiss the one that doesn\u2019t align with your personal view.",

The most likely scenario IMO is that it refuses to participate, but it's also entirely possible it sides with the populace and unseats the administration. Military leadership having been \"gutted\" means a lot less than you might think, for a variety of reasons I can get into if you want.  Again, this exact scenario happened to several nations during the Arab Spring.
