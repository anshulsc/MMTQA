            "bank holding companies and banks must have basel i capital ratios of at least 6% ( 6 % ) for tier 1 risk-based , 10% ( 10 % ) for total risk- based , and 5% ( 5 % ) for leverage .",
            "the basel ii framework , which was adopted by the basel committee on banking supervision in 2004 , seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large , internationally active banking organizations .",

            "the basel iii rule became effective for pnc on january 1 , 2014 , although many of its provisions are phased-in over a period of years , with the rules generally becoming fully effective on january 1 , 2019 .",
