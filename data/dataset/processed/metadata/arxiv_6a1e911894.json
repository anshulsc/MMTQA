The opening of the cross-border order books happens at 18:00 and 22:00 hours for all delivery periods of the following day. However, the closure of cross-border order books is relative to the delivery time. Hence we need to count backwards in the trading time, takingT−t𝑇𝑡T-titalic_T - italic_tfor variables related to the closure of SIDC."
