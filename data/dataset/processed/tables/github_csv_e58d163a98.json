Participants The study involved 19 obese women (defined by a body mass index (body mass index (BMI), the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) \u226530 kg/m2) who agreed to participate in a program comprising a hypocaloric weight-loss Mediterranean diet and physical activity.

Furthermore, nutritional group meetings were held monthly to increase the motivation of all participants. Concerning the physical activity program, a daily exercise practice was recommended. The minimum aim was walking an average of 150 min per week. This minimum level of defined activity was based on the cardiometabolic benefit demonstrated in other studies [31].  Participants were assessed and encouraged to gradually increase their level of physical activity to reach at least 45 min per day at the end of the six-month intervention period.",

All the post-intervention fmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed within 24\u201372 h after completing the intervention. They were asked to refrain from eating or drinking (except water) for five hours before the scan. All the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed at the same time in the afternoon. Functional connectivity of the regions of interest was assessed using a seed-based correlation approach. Three participants were not included in the analysis because they did not perform the second magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (one did not complete the intervention and two did not want to be scanned again, although they completed the intervention).",

Following the usual pipeline for seed-based correlation analyses, a first-level individual analysis was initially carried out, followed by a second-level group analysis. Firstly, an ROI-to-ROI approach was used: the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal timeline at each seed region was checked for correlations with the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal timeline at each of the other preselected regions.",

As mentioned, these correlations were initially studied on an individual level, and then the second level of analysis was applied. Here, the parametric (z-score) values obtained for each individual were compared, both at the ROI-to-ROI and at the seed-to-voxel levels. In particular, a paired t-test allowed assessment of changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal correlation associated to the program for each seed.  For ROI-to-ROI analyses, two-sided family-wise error (family wise error (FWE)) correction was applied at the analysis level, with a significance threshold of p = 0.05.",
