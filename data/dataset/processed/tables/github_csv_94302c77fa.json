      "They also voted against undoing Trump's tariffs.  Took Vance's vote to get this done, too, since McConnell is apparently still too afraid of Trump to show up in opposition.  Yet they still want to blame the WORST economy since Trump's last term on BIDEN.  If they're going to force Trump blunders down our throats, these weasels could AT LEAST take responsibility for the mess they're making.   MIDTERMS CAN'T COME SOON ENOUGH!",

      "Let me add the rest of what should have been in the headline: \u201cwithout due process.\"   And there it is. There's the actual endgame.\u00a0   Here in Alabama, one of our state legislators just presented a bill to move inmates imprisoned in Alabama to overseas prisons. He knew it wouldn't pass this session, because it's too late in the session. (Read: He didn't say it wouldn't pass because members would vote it down.) It was clearly a message to the people, as he said it was, as well as a test run to gauge public outrage.\u00a0   Trump has already floated the idea.\u00a0   I'm curious now as to how many other states have seen ideas like this being floated around.\u00a0   The administration has learned that there are no legal consequences to having masked mystery men snatch people off the street, even if they're getting the wrong target, and tossing them into an unmarked van and never allowing them to contact a relative or lawyer. They've learned that\u00a0all they need to do is get someone out of the country quickly enough to suspend their constitutional rights.\u00a0   Why in the fucking fuckity fuck would anyone even come close to thinking that this would stop at illegal immigrants and/or criminals? It shouldn't have even started there, and this right here is why.\u00a0",
