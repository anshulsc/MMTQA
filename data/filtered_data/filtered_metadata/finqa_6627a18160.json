            "we satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds , letters of credit , or insurance policies ( financial assurance instruments ) , or trust deposits , which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets .",
            "the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping , closure and post-closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations .",
