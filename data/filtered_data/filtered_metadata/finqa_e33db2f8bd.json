            "in september 2007 , we reached a settlement with the united states department of justice to resolve an investigation into financial relationships between major orthopaedic manufacturers and consulting orthopaedic surgeons .",
            "under the terms of the settlement , we paid a civil settlement amount of $ 169.5 million and we recorded an expense in that amount .",
            "at the time , no tax benefit was recorded related to the settlement expense due to the uncertainty as to the tax treatment .",

            "fin 48 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements .",
            "under fin 48 , we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities , based on the technical merits of the position .",
            "the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement .",
            "fin 48 also provides guidance on derecognition , classification , interest and penalties on income taxes , accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures .",
            "we adopted fin 48 on january 1 , 2007 .",
            "prior to the adoption of fin 48 we had a long term tax liability for expected settlement of various federal , state and foreign income tax liabilities that was reflected net of the corollary tax impact of these expected settlements of $ 102.1 million , as well as a separate accrued interest liability of $ 1.7 million .",
            "as a result of the adoption of fin 48 , we are required to present the different components of such liability on a gross basis versus the historical net presentation .",
            "the adoption resulted in the financial statement liability for unrecognized tax benefits decreasing by $ 6.4 million as of january 1 , 2007 .",
            "the adoption resulted in this decrease in the liability as well as a reduction to retained earnings of $ 4.8 million , a reduction in goodwill of $ 61.4 million , the establishment of a tax receivable of $ 58.2 million , which was recorded in other current and non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheet , and an increase in an interest/penalty payable of $ 7.9 million , all as of january 1 , 2007 .",
            "therefore , after the adoption of fin 48 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 95.7 million as of january 1 , 2007 .",
            "as of december 31 , 2008 , the amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $ 129.5 million .",
            "of this amount , $ 45.5 million would impact our effective tax rate if recognized .",
            "$ 38.2 million of the $ 129.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions of acquired entities taken prior to their acquisition by us .",
            "under fas 141 ( r ) , if these liabilities are settled for different amounts , they will affect the income tax expense in the period of reversal or settlement .",
