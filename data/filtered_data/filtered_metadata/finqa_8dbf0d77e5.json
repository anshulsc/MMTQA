            "/ 2003 annual report 65 the commercial specific loss component of the allowance was $ 917 million at december 31 , 2003 , a decrease of 43% ( 43 % ) from year-end 2002 .",
            "the decrease was attributable to the improve- ment in the credit quality of the commercial loan portfolio , as well as the reduction in the size of the portfolio .",
            "the commercial expected loss component of the allowance was $ 454 million at december 31 , 2003 , a decrease of 26% ( 26 % ) from year- end 2002 .",
            "the decrease reflected an improvement in the average quality of the loan portfolio , as well as the improving credit envi- ronment , which affected inputs to the expected loss model .",
            "the consumer expected loss component of the allowance was $ 2.3 billion at december 31 , 2003 , a decrease of 4% ( 4 % ) from year- end 2002 .",
            "although the consumer managed loan portfolio increased by 10% ( 10 % ) , the businesses that drove the increase , home finance and auto finance , have collateralized products with lower expected loss rates .",
            "the residual component of the allowance was $ 895 million at december 31 , 2003 .",
            "the residual component , which incorpo- rates management's judgment , addresses uncertainties that are not considered in the formula-based commercial specific and expected components of the allowance for credit losses .",
            "the $ 121 million increase addressed uncertainties in the eco- nomic environment and concentrations in the commercial loan portfolio that existed during the first half of 2003 .",
            "in the sec- ond half of the year , as commercial credit quality continued to improve and the commercial allowance declined further , the residual component was reduced as well .",
            "at december 31 , 2003 , the residual component represented approximately 20% ( 20 % ) of the total allowance for loan losses , within the firm 2019s target range of between 10% ( 10 % ) and 20% ( 20 % ) .",
            "the firm anticipates that if the current positive trend in economic conditions and credit quality continues , the commercial and residual components will continue to be reduced .",
            "lending-related commitments to provide for the risk of loss inherent in the credit-extension process , management also computes specific and expected loss components as well as a residual component for commercial lending 2013related commitments .",
            "this is computed using a methodology similar to that used for the commercial loan port- folio , modified for expected maturities and probabilities of drawdown .",
            "the allowance decreased by 11% ( 11 % ) to $ 324 million as of december 31 , 2003 , due to improvement in the criticized portion of the firm 2019s lending-related commitments .",
