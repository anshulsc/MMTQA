            "2008 revenues , net of interest expense increased 11% ( 11 % ) or $ 2.7 billion , as markets began to recover in the early part of 2009 , bringing back higher levels of volume activity and higher levels of liquidity , which began to decline again in the third quarter of 2009 .",
            "the growth in revenue in the early part of the year was mainly due to a $ 7.1 billion increase in fixed income markets , reflecting strong trading opportunities across all asset classes in the first half of 2009 , and a $ 1.5 billion increase in investment banking revenue primarily from increases in debt and equity underwriting activities reflecting higher transaction volumes from depressed 2008 levels .",
            "these increases were offset by a $ 6.4 billion decrease in lending revenue primarily from losses on credit default swap hedges .",
            "excluding the 2009 and 2008 cva impact , as indicated in the table below , revenues increased 23% ( 23 % ) or $ 5.5 billion .",
            "operating expenses decreased 17% ( 17 % ) , or $ 2.7 billion .",
            "excluding the 2008 repositioning and restructuring charges and the 2009 litigation reserve release , operating expenses declined 11% ( 11 % ) or $ 1.6 billion , mainly as a result of headcount reductions and benefits from expense management .",
            "provisions for loan losses and for benefits and claims decreased 7% ( 7 % ) or $ 129 million , to $ 1.7 billion , mainly due to lower credit reserve builds and net credit losses , due to an improved credit environment , particularly in the latter part of the year .",
            "2008 vs .",
            "2007 revenues , net of interest expense decreased 2% ( 2 % ) or $ 0.4 billion reflecting the overall difficult market conditions .",
            "excluding the 2008 and 2007 cva impact , revenues decreased 3% ( 3 % ) or $ 0.6 billion .",
            "the reduction in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in investment banking revenue of $ 2.3 billion to $ 3.2 billion , mainly in debt and equity underwriting , reflecting lower volumes , and a decrease in equity markets revenue of $ 2.3 billion to $ 2.9 billion due to extremely high volatility and reduced levels of activity .",
            "these reductions were offset by an increase in fixed income markets of $ 2.9 billion to $ 14.4 billion due to strong performance in interest rates and currencies , and an increase in lending revenue of $ 2.4 billion to $ 4.2 billion mainly from gains on credit default swap hedges .",
            "operating expenses decreased by 2% ( 2 % ) or $ 0.4 billion .",
            "excluding the 2008 and 2007 repositioning and restructuring charges and the 2007 litigation reserve reversal , operating expenses decreased by 7% ( 7 % ) or $ 1.1 billion driven by headcount reduction and lower performance-based incentives .",
            "provisions for credit losses and for benefits and claims increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 1.8 billion mainly from higher credit reserve builds and net credit losses offset by a lower provision for unfunded lending commitments due to deterioration in the credit environment .",
