            "in addition , investing & lending included net revenues of $ 96 million from debt securities and loans .",
            "this amount includes approximately $ 1 billion of unrealized losses related to relationship lending activities , including the effect of hedges , offset by net interest income and net gains from other debt securities and loans .",

            "the net gain from other investments in equities was primarily driven by an increase in global equity markets , which resulted in appreciation of both our public and private equity positions and provided favorable conditions for initial public offerings .",
            "the net gains and net interest from debt securities and loans primarily reflected the impact of tighter credit spreads and favorable credit markets during the year , which provided favorable conditions for borrowers to refinance .",
            "operating expenses were $ 2.67 billion for 2011 , 20% ( 20 % ) lower than 2010 , due to decreased compensation and benefits expenses , primarily resulting from lower net revenues .",
            "this decrease was partially offset by the impact of impairment charges related to consolidated investments during 2011 .",
            "pre-tax loss was $ 531 million in 2011 , compared with pre-tax earnings of $ 4.18 billion in 2010 .",
