            "4 4 m a n a g e m e n t 2019 s d i s c u s s i o n notes to table ( continued ) ( a ) ( continued ) management believes that operating income , as adjusted , and operating margin , as adjusted , are effective indicators of blackrock 2019s financial performance over time .",
            "as such , management believes that operating income , as adjusted , and operating margin , as adjusted , provide useful disclosure to investors .",
            "operating income , as adjusted : bgi transaction and integration costs recorded in 2010 and 2009 consist principally of certain advisory payments , compensation expense , legal fees , marketing and promotional , occupancy and consulting expenses incurred in conjunction with the bgi transaction .",
            "restructuring charges recorded in 2009 and 2008 consist of compensation costs , occupancy costs and professional fees .",
            "the expenses associated with restructuring and bgi transaction and integration costs have been deemed non-recurring by management and have been excluded from operating income , as adjusted , to help enhance the comparability of this information to the current reporting periods .",
            "as such , management believes that operating margins exclusive of these costs are useful measures in evaluating blackrock 2019s operating performance for the respective periods .",
            "the portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans ( 201cltip 201d ) that will be funded through the distribution to participants of shares of blackrock stock held by pnc and a merrill lynch cash compensation contribution , a portion of which has been received , have been excluded because these charges ultimately do not impact blackrock 2019s book value .",
            "compensation expense associated with appreciation/ ( depreciation ) on investments related to certain blackrock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans , which substantially offset this expense , are reported in non-operating income ( expense ) .",
            "operating margin , as adjusted : operating income used for measuring operating margin , as adjusted , is equal to operating income , as adjusted , excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions .",
            "management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the company 2019s results until future periods .",
            "operating margin , as adjusted , allows the company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur , recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements , such as restructuring charges , transaction and integration costs , closed-end fund launch costs , commissions paid to certain employees as compensation and fluctua- tions in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans .",
            "the company also uses operating margin , as adjusted , to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies .",
            "management uses both the gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating the financial performance of blackrock .",
            "the non-gaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of the company 2019s revenues and expenses .",
            "revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties .",
            "management believes that excluding such costs is useful to blackrock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services , which due to the terms of the contracts , are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory , administration fees and securities lending revenue .",
            "amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement , as adjusted , because such costs , over time , offset distribution fee revenue earned by the company .",
            "reimbursable property management compensation represented com- pensation and benefits paid to personnel of metric property management , inc .",
            "( 201cmetric 201d ) , a subsidiary of blackrock realty advisors , inc .",

            "prior to the transfer in 2008 , these employees were retained on metric 2019s payroll when certain properties were acquired by realty 2019s clients .",
            "the related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by realty 2019s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , because they did not bear an economic cost to blackrock .",
            "for each of these items , blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues .",

            "the compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income .",
            "this compensation expense has been included in non-operating income ( expense ) , less net income ( loss ) attributable to nci , as adjusted , to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans , which are reported in non-operating income ( expense ) , gaap basis. ."
