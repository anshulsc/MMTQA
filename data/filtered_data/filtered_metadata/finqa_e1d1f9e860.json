            "they bear interest at a fixed rate of 5.61% ( 5.61 % ) for the first 10 years ending july 2015 .",
            "thereafter , the rate will float at three month libor plus 1.25% ( 1.25 % ) .",
            "the securities are redeemable at par .",
            "restrictive covenants the terms of the 2011 revolving credit facility and certain of our senior unsecured notes include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit , among other things , our ability to pay dividends ( as discussed below ) , make certain types of investments , incur additional indebtedness , incur liens and enter into negative pledge agreements and the disposition of assets , and which require compliance with financial ratios including our minimum tangible net worth , a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to total asset value , a minimum ratio of ebitda to fixed charges and a maximum ratio of unsecured indebtedness to unencumbered asset value .",
            "the dividend restriction referred to above provides that we will not during any time when we are in default , make distributions with respect to common stock or other equity interests , except to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes .",

            "a a0hypothetical 100 a0basis point increase in interest rates along the entire interest rate curve for 2011 and 2010 , would increase our annual interest cost by approximately $ 12.3 a0million and $ 11.0 a0mil- lion and would increase our share of joint venture annual interest cost by approximately $ 4.8 a0million and $ 6.7 a0million , respectively .",
            "we recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value .",
            "derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income .",
            "if a derivative is a hedge , depending on the nature of the hedge , changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset , liability , or firm commitment through earnings , or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings .",
