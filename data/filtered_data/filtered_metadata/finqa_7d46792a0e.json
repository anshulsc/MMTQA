            "natural gas prices on average were lower in 2009 than in 2008 and in 2007 , with prices in 2008 hitting uniquely high levels .",
            "a significant portion of our natural gas production in the lower 48 states of the u.s .",
            "is sold at bid-week prices or first-of-month indices relative to our specific producing areas .",
            "a large portion of natural gas sales in alaska are subject to term contracts .",
            "our other major natural gas-producing regions are europe and equatorial guinea , where large portions of our natural gas sales are also subject to term contracts , making realized prices in these areas less volatile .",
            "as we sell larger quantities of natural gas from these regions , to the extent that these fixed prices are lower than prevailing prices , our reported average natural gas prices realizations may be less than benchmark natural gas prices .",

            "roughly two-thirds of the normal output mix will track movements in wti and one-third will track movements in the canadian heavy sour crude oil marker , primarily western canadian select .",
            "output mix can be impacted by operational problems or planned unit outages at the mine or the upgrader .",
            "the operating cost structure of the oil sands mining operations is predominantly fixed and therefore many of the costs incurred in times of full operation continue during production downtime .",
            "per-unit costs are sensitive to production rates .",
            "key variable costs are natural gas and diesel fuel , which track commodity markets such as the canadian aeco natural gas sales index and crude prices respectively .",
