            "management uses both gaap and non-gaap financial measures in evaluating blackrock 2019s financial performance .",
            "the non-gaap measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all of blackrock 2019s revenues and expenses .",
            "operating income used for measuring operating margin , as adjusted , is equal to operating income , as adjusted , excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and related commissions .",
            "management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact blackrock 2019s results until future periods .",
            "revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and other third parties .",
            "management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services , which due to the terms of the contracts , are accounted for under gaap on a net basis within investment advisory , administration fees and securities lending revenue .",
            "amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement , as adjusted , because such costs , over time , substantially offset distribution fee revenue the company earns .",
            "for each of these items , blackrock excludes from revenue used for operating margin , as adjusted , the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues .",

            "management believes nonoperating income ( expense ) , less net income ( loss ) attributable to nci , as adjusted , provides comparability of information among reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing blackrock 2019s nonoperating contribution to results .",
            "as compensation expense associated with ( appreciation ) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans , which is included in operating income , substantially offsets the gain ( loss ) on the investments set aside for these plans , management believes nonoperating income ( expense ) , less net income ( loss ) attributable to nci , as adjusted , provides a useful measure , for both management and investors , of blackrock 2019s nonoperating results that impact book value .",
