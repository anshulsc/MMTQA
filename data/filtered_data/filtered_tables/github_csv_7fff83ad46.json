Three White Sturgeon were captured, tagged, and relocated to the SJR. Two sturgeon were captured on 22 June and one on 24 June 2021. After the relocation, CDFW monitored the same pool in the Tuolumne River throughout the summer by using an Adaptive Resolution Imaging Sonar (ARIS, Explorer 1800) for the presence of any remaining sturgeon. The ARIS captured images of one sturgeon on 8 August 2021 and another image of two sturgeon three weeks later (Fig. 3). We did not attempt to capture either sturgeon due to increased handling stress related to summer air temperatures and shallow depths at the relocation site. CDFW continued to confirm the presence of these fish until September, when Water Hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) covered the pool and prevented CDFW from monitoring with a boat and ARIS. CDFW was able to resume monitoring in December after precipitation increased flows, moving the large patch of vegetation downstream; however, no sturgeon were detected with the ARIS."

The Lake Pillsbury (LPB), East Park Reservoir (EPR), and Bear Valley/Cache Creek (BV/CC) Elk Management Units (EMUs) contain both helicopter survey (MCDS) transects spaced at 800 m intervals, flown in 2018 and 2019 to gather observation data for abundance estimation following linetransect distance sampling methodology as well as fecal DNA spatial capture-recapture (SCR) transects sampled in Jun\ufffdAug 2017\ufffd2019 (Batter et al. 2022). Blue polygons signify major water bodies. The climate is Mediterranean and characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters (Kauffman 2003). Average annual precipitation is ~76 cm, mostly occurring as rain from October through May. The landscape is rugged, with rolling foothills and grassy flats interspersed through broken peaks and ridges descending into narrow valleys; elevations range from 30\ufffd2,094 m. The dominant habitat types include blue oak (Quercus douglasii) woodland, annual grassland, chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum) chaparral, chamise and redshank (A. sparsifolium) chaparral, montane hardwood conifer, blue oak\ufffdfoothill pine (Pinus sabiniana) and agricultural lands (CDFW 2018). The landscape is made up of a mosaic of these habitat types, with private property predominantly made up of oak and open grassland in larger valleys and favorable upper slopes which grade into mixed grasslands and oak woodlands; public-administered lands are primarily composed of chaparral communities along dry, steep slopes, with smaller patches of oak woodland and mixed hardwood occurring intermittently. The primary private land uses are cattle ranching and crop production with public lands reserved for outdoor recreation including hunting, fishing, hiking, horseback riding, and wildlife viewing. "

County boundaries are represented in light grey. Note: genetic assignment testing of elk in Siskiyou County (undercrossing structures 3 and 4) suggested that populations were composed of both Roosevelt and Rocky Mountain elk and their hybrids (Meredith et al. 2007). Thus, we describe the elk population(s) here as Roosevelt x Rocky Mountain elk. Based on over two years of repeated expert observations confirmed with trail cameras, a Fort Hunter Liggett tule elk herd in southern Monterey County is repeatedly utilizing a relatively small rectangular culvert where Jolon Creek, a tributary of the San Antonio River, crosses under County Route G14 (Jolon Road)"
