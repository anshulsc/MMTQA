The EIRA intervention was perceived as appropriate and acceptable by Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals and participants. The intervention was feasible, the required number of participants was recruited, and the percentage of losses was lower than anticipated. However, the fidelity level of the planned intervention was low, with only the individual approach to promote physical activity BC exceeding 50%.",

      "  The EIRA study has several strengths. We intended to develop a flexible intervention that could be adapted to different Primary Health Care (PHC) settings, and the intervention\u2019s design was based on the results of previous phases of the study. Additionally, we used theoretical frameworks for the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and evaluation. Comparative Fit Index (CFI)R constructs were used as variables in investigating implementation outcomes, and we have been able to provide explicit links between them to help better understand intervention effects and implementation barriers. However, several limitations exist. Baseline imbalance and confounding bias can occur in cluster randomised trials [33]. There were a higher proportion of participants in pre-action stages in the control group than in the intervention group, especially in the preparation stage.",

      " Since this imbalance might have contributed to overestimating the effect of the intervention, we have included the baseline stages of change in the logistic regression models as covariates. However, there may be unknown or unmeasured confounders for which statistical analysis has been unable to adjust. To avoid this bias, we could have used an independent recruiter blinded to allocation. However, this hybrid trial is inherently pragmatic since it was designed to evaluate the feasibility of recruitment in the real practice of Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals. Furthermore, we have assessed the fidelity outcome using an indirect measure based on adherence to activities instead of on the professional\u2019s skills to carry them out, which might underrepresent true fidelity. However, the differential association with the Comparative Fit Index (CFI)R constructs supported its discriminant validity.",

      "  In accordance with the current results, previous studies have demonstrated that Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions can successfully promote small improvements in dietary and physical activity behaviours and smoking cessation [6]. The dietary BC was more relevant and significant, in agreement with other studies on Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions in Primary Health Care (PHC) settings and population-based studies [55, 56]. Although different studies show that Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions can slightly increase physical activity, the EIRA intervention did not make statistically significant BC in physical activity [6]. Fernald et al. [55] found that the Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) intervention was only effective in promoting physical activity BC in two of the seven participating networks, and Campbell et al. [56] did not observe any effect of the intervention on this behaviour.",

      " In our study, the individual approach to promote physical activity BC had the highest fidelity (52.2%). However, of all individual approaches, physical activity was particularly complemented by the community approach, which presented the lowest fidelity (19.1%). We believe that this might account for the low effectiveness of the intervention in changing this behaviour. No effect was observed regarding smoking cessation. Since changes in smoking are negatively associated with changes in other behaviours, an individual health BC intervention might be more adequate for smoking cessation [6].  Several factors have influenced the effectiveness of the EIRA intervention compared to usual care. The training centre status had a negative effect on physical BC. The study by March et al. [10] found a negative association between Primary Health Care (PHC) training centres and health-promoting community activities.",

      " Recently, Primary Health Care (PHC) interventions to increase physical activity have been integrated into usual practice in Spain [41, 57], and non-training Primary Health Care (PHC) centres might have been more motivated to promote physical activity BC. Additionally, the preparation stage appears to promote change for any of the three behaviours studied. Previous research shows that people in a higher stage for one behaviour are also more likely to be in a higher stage for another behaviour [58]. Co-occurrence of non-adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern and insufficient physical activity explained dietary BC more than any other combination of concurrent behaviours. In line with other studies [4], it was the most prevalent health behaviour combination (56.4% of the study population), which may have increased its explanatory potential over the other three behaviour combinations.",

      " Dietary and physical activity behaviours are positively correlated, and while it has been suggested that change in one behaviour facilitates change in the other [59, 60], in our study, the concurrence of these unhealthy behaviours was negatively related to Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC). These results are consistent with further Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) research, which found that of the two behaviours, only the diet improved [56]. These inconsistencies highlight the need to generate more evidence on predictors of coaction in Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions [61, 62].  Very little was found in the literature on the implementation of Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions in Primary Health Care (PHC).

Similarly, both studies found that some constructs such as Complexity, External Policy and Incentives, and Structural characteristics were not associated with implementation success, perhaps because they negatively influenced all Primary Health Care (PHC) centres. In this study, the influence of some of these constructs even determined the dropout of a Primary Health Care (PHC) centre. However, the current study\u2019s findings do not support that Adaptability does not positively influence any Primary Health Care (PHC) centres. On the other hand, we found several determinants associated with implementation success such as Relative Priority, Available Resources, Leadership engagement, and Culture that Martinez et al.

Leadership Engagement was negatively correlated with the intervention fidelity of the group approach, i.e., less Leadership Engagement more intervention fidelity, probably because the predominance of a laissez-faire leadership style leaves a significant degree of participation and responsibility in organisational decision-making to professionals [64]. Leadership profoundly influences any organisation\u2019s culture [65], which might explain why the Culture construct also emerged as a distinguishing construct.",

Furthermore, healthcare services are currently facing the difficult task of providing care due to limited resources and unlimited demands, so priority setting and rationing are applied.

The readiness of Primary Health Care (PHC) services for the implementation of Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions requires resources and leadership. Evidence points to the strong relationship between the adequacy of an organisation\u2019s resources and the adoption of innovative practices [67]. In addition, facilitative leadership is essential to shift organisations toward a culture of innovation [68]. Significantly, Primary Health Care (PHC) professionals considered the implementation of the intervention complex, mainly because they had to tackle three unhealthy behaviours at the same time. Unlike interventions aimed at changing a single behaviour, the field of MBHC is still relatively unknown.",

Coaction is also an aspect of Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) on which research is needed. It occurs when \u201ctaking effective action on one behaviour increases the odds of taking effective action on a second behaviour\u201d and reflects behaviours that change together and increases the impact of Multiple Health Behaviour Change (MHBC) interventions [62].
