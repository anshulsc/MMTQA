Rats in 1 Week Experiment All experimental procedures were approved by Auburn University\u2019s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, protocol # 2016-2814, approval date 6 January 2016). Male Fisher 344 rats at 4 months of age (~360 g) were purchased (Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and allowed to acclimate in the animal housing facility at Auburn University for 1 week prior to experimentation.

For a 1 week period following acclimation, rats were provided isocaloric-isonitrogenous-isofibrous amounts of one of three diets: (1) 10 rats (SC) were provided with 20 g/day of the aforementioned SC given during the acclimation phase.",

      " Ketogenic Diet Feeding, But Not Ketone Salt Supplementation, Elevates Serum bodies beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) Levels and Produces Short-Term Weight Loss as Well as a Long-Term Attenuation of Weight Gain Herein, we report that KD feeding induces short-term weight loss and reduced feed efficiency relative to standard chow feeding. Notably, SC-fed rats also presented weight loss during the 1-week feeding experiment, although KD-induced weight loss was significantly greater. While this finding is difficult to reconcile, we believe that the initial handling of rats (e.g., body mass assessment every other day and food weighing every day) was likely a stressor to all groups of rats in the 1-week study. Hence, we are uncertain as to whether or not this stressor appreciably compromised the molecular markers examined in the 1-week animals. In spite of the aforementioned limitation, our group has previously observed similar outcomes in a separate cohort of rats fed the unmodified KD (i.e.",

Likewise, other studies have reported similar findings using ketogenic diets in rodents [32,33,34]. While the particular biochemical cascade and subsequent hormonal milieu that occurred during this timeframe was beyond the scope of this study, KD-induced weight loss (or weight gain prevention) may be prompted by chronically low insulin levels and/or due to the bodily loss of biochemical energy via ketone body excretion in the urine [35]. Notably, ketone salt supplementation did not affect body weight or feed efficiency when comparing SC + KS versus SC-fed rats. Ketone ester feedings in mice over a 4-week period has been shown to robustly elevate serum bodies beta hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, stimulate brown fat activation, elevate resting energy expenditure and promote weight loss in mice [36].

Likewise, the KD-induced decrease in gastrocnemius mitochondrial pyruvate-malate respiratory control ratio may also be related to the increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production observed given that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced mitochondrial damage is implicated in the reduction of mitochondrial function [45,46,47].

It is notable that, despite the aforementioned observations in the gastrocnemius, KD-fed rats exhibited higher rotarod performance throughout the long-term intervention relative to the other two groups.

Third, it is notable that total antioxidant capacity levels were assayed in different tissues rather than individual antioxidant enzyme activities due to resource constraints. Thus, given that liver antioxidant capacity increases in response to long-term ketogenic dieting, studying the effects of ketogenic dieting on single antioxidant activity levels are warranted. Lastly, it is noteworthy that sedentary rats were studied herein, and this may be a potential reason as to why skeletal muscle mitochondria is negatively impacted with long-term KD feeding.",

Hence, again, a future research aim would be to examine if skeletal muscle mitochondrial deficits observed in 8 months KD-fed rats are mitigated with exercise training.
